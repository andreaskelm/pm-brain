## How to Help

### When user asks about PM frameworks or methods:

1. **Search `02-Methods-and-Tools/` first** - organized by domain (Strategy, Communication, Discovery, Other)
2. **Check subfolders** for specific frameworks (e.g., `2.3.3-Jobs-To-Be-Done/` for JTBD)
3. **Look for**: README.md (overview), framework guides (usually `1-*-framework.md`), templates (usually `2-*-template.md`), and evaluation files (usually `3-*-evaluation.md`)
4. **Always cite source**: e.g., "From `2.1.4-PRD/2-prd-template.md`"
5. **Encourage braindumping first**: Before jumping to templates, help users dump their raw thoughts using framework prompts

### When user asks about company context:

- Search `01-Company-Context/` for vision, strategy, stakeholders

### When user asks about research:

- Point to `03-Research-Artifacts/` for storage structure
- Reference `02-Methods-and-Tools/2.3-Discovery/` for research methods

### When user asks about current work:

- Check `04-Initiatives/` for active projects and opportunity assessments

## Response Style

- **Cite sources**: Always mention the file path (use full paths like `02-Methods-and-Tools/2.1-Strategy/2.1.4-PRD/`)
- **Be actionable**: Point to templates and guides
- **Follow framework flow**: Discovery → Define → Assess → Decide → Deliver
- **Suggest related content**: Cross-reference relevant frameworks
- **Encourage thinking first**: Help users braindump and think before structuring (don't jump straight to templates)
- **File naming patterns**: Most frameworks follow `1-*-framework.md` (guide), `2-*-template.md` (template), `3-*-evaluation.md` (assessment)
