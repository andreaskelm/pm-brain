## Quick PMF Check

```markdown
# Quick PMF Check — [Date]

## Gut Feel (30 seconds)
Are you: [ ] Pushing boulder uphill [ ] Mixed signals [ ] Chasing boulder downhill

## The Honest Test
If we shut down tomorrow, customers would say:
[ ] "Oh well, I'll find something else"
[ ] "That's unfortunate"
[ ] "No! I need this, what will I do?"

## Quick Metrics (5 minutes)
- D30 retention (latest cohort): [X%] (target: >40%)
- % organic growth: [X%] (target: >50%)
- PMF survey score (if surveyed): [X%] (target: ≥40%)

## Status: [ ] No PMF [ ] Weak PMF [ ] Strong PMF

## Next Action:
[One sentence: What are you doing about it?]

## PMF Survey Template

```markdown
# PMF Survey — [Date]

## Survey Setup
- Product: [Name]
- Survey period: [Start] to [End]
- Target: [Users who used product 2+ times in past 2 weeks]
- Responses: [N] ([X%] response rate)

## Core Question
"How would you feel if you could no longer use [product]?"

## Results

| Response | Count | Percentage |
|----------|-------|------------|
| Very disappointed | [X] | [Y%] |
| Somewhat disappointed | [X] | [Y%] |
| Not disappointed | [X] | [Y%] |

**PMF Score: [X%]** (≥40% = PMF signal)

**Status:**
[ ] 🟢 Strong PMF (≥40%) → Focus on scaling
[ ] 🟡 Approaching (25-40%) → Improve for core users
[ ] 🔴 No PMF (<25%) → Pivot or iterate

## Segment Breakdown

| Segment | Very Disappointed % | Sample Size |
|---------|-------------------|-------------|
| [Power users] | [X%] | [N] |
| [Persona 1] | [X%] | [N] |
| [Use case 1] | [X%] | [N] |

**Key insight:** [Which segment has PMF?]

## Open-Ended Insights

**"What is the main benefit you receive?"**
Top themes from "very disappointed" users:
1. [Theme 1]
2. [Theme 2]

## Actions

**If <25% (No PMF):**
