# Product-Market Fit Framework

## Introduction

Use this framework to assess product-market fit status and determine when to scale vs. iterate. Product-market fit is an ongoing state that requires continuous validation, not a one-time achievement. This framework helps you measure PMF through quantitative surveys, retention metrics, and qualitative signals.

**When to use this framework:**
- Early stage product validation
- Assessing product-market fit status
- Deciding when to scale vs. when to iterate
- Validating new markets or segments
- Determining investment priorities

**When PMF assessment might not be needed:**
- Very early concept stage (before MVP)
- Product is enterprise with 2-3 customers only
- PMF obviously exists (scaling phase)
- One-off features or experiments

## How to Use This Framework

### Step 0: Braindump & Product Sense (Do this first!)

**Before assessing PMF, braindump:**
- What does your product sense tell you? Are you pushing a boulder uphill or chasing one downhill?
- What would make you say "we obviously have PMF"?
- What would make you say "we obviously don't have PMF"?
- What biases might affect your assessment? (Confirmation bias? Vanity metrics?)

**Product sense exercise:**
- If you stopped marketing tomorrow, would people still find and use your product?
- When customers describe your product, do they say "nice" or "I can't live without this"?
- What would great product sense notice about your retention curves?

### Step 1: Run PMF Survey
Use the standardized survey question with qualified users (used product 2+ times in past 2 weeks)

### Step 2: Measure Retention
Track cohort retention curves and daily active usage patterns

### Step 3: Assess Growth
Measure organic growth percentage and viral coefficient

### Step 4: Evaluate Engagement
Track DAU/MAU ratio and power user patterns

### Step 5: Check Monetization
Calculate LTV/CAC ratio and net revenue retention

### Step 6: Gather Qualitative Signals
Assess customer feedback and behavior patterns

### Step 7: Determine Status
Classify as No PMF, Weak PMF, Strong PMF, or Lost PMF

### Step 8: Take Action
Scale if strong, iterate if weak, pivot if none

### Step 9: Self-Reflection
After assessment, reflect:
- What did you learn? What surprised you?
- What biases did you catch? (Vanity metrics? Confirmation bias?)
- How did your product sense guide you?
- What would you do differently next time?

## How to Maintain

- **Weekly**: Track retention and growth metrics
- **Monthly**: Quick PMF check and user interviews
- **Every 4-6 weeks (Pre-PMF)**: Run PMF survey
- **Quarterly (Post-PMF)**: Full PMF assessment
- **After Major Changes**: Re-assess PMF status

## How This Fits in the System

**Discovery Frameworks (2.2-Discovery/):**
- Use `2.2.1-Research-Interviews/` to understand customer needs
- Use `2.2.2-Continuous-Discovery-Habits/` to synthesize evidence
- Use `2.2.3-Jobs-To-Be-Done/` to frame customer progress
- Use `2.2.4-Opportunity-Assessment/` to structure early thinking
- Use `2.2.5-Idea-Validation/` to test solutions before PMF

**Strategy & Delivery (2.1-Strategy/):**
- Use `2.1.2-OKR/` to set objectives based on PMF status (learning metrics pre-PMF, growth metrics post-PMF)
- Use `2.1.3-Roadmap/` to plan timeline (experimental pre-PMF, strategic post-PMF)
- Use `2.3-Execution/2.1.4-PRD/` to specify requirements when PMF is validated
