# Supporting Frameworks

This guide covers supporting frameworks that complement Double Diamond and Opportunity Solution Tree: Jobs to Be Done (JTBD), Five Whys, and How Might We (HMW) questions.

## Jobs to Be Done (JTBD)

**When to Use:** Understanding the underlying "job" customers are hiring your product to do.

**Core Concept:** Customers don't buy products; they hire them to make progress in their lives.

**JTBD Interview Format:**

```
Timeline Questions:
1. When did you first realize you needed something like this?
2. What were you doing at that moment?
3. What made that the right time to look for a solution?
4. What did you try before finding our product?
5. What made you choose us over alternatives?
6. What happened after you started using it?
```

**JTBD Statement Template:**

```
When [situation],
I want to [motivation],
So I can [expected outcome].

Example:
When I'm preparing for an important presentation,
I want to quickly find relevant data insights,
So I can make compelling arguments backed by evidence.
```

**Forces of Progress (JTBD):**

```
Push: Current pain points
↓
[Current State] ──────────→ [New State]
↑ ↑
Anxiety: Fear of change Pull: Attraction to new solution

Habit: Inertia of current
```

**How JTBD Helps Problem-Solution Space Exploration:**

- **In Problem Space:** Understand what customers are really trying to accomplish (not just what they say they want)
- **In Solution Space:** Generate solutions that address the underlying job, not just surface features
- **In Opportunity Mapping:** Frame opportunities in terms of jobs customers are trying to get done

## Five Whys

**When to Use:** Getting to root causes instead of symptoms.

**Process:**

1. State the problem
1. Ask "Why does this happen?"
1. Ask "Why?" to that answer
1. Repeat 5 times (or until you reach root cause)
1. Address the root cause, not symptoms

**Example:**

```
Problem: Users abandon onboarding

Why? They don't complete the setup flow
Why? The setup flow is too long
Why? We ask for too much information upfront
Why? We designed the flow to collect all data at once
Why? We assumed we needed everything before users could start

Root Cause: We prioritized our data needs over user experience
```

**Tips:**

- Sometimes you need more than 5 whys
- Sometimes you reach root cause sooner
- Can branch when multiple causes exist
- Works best with diverse team perspectives

**How Five Whys Helps Problem-Solution Space Exploration:**

- **In Define Phase:** Get to root causes before framing the problem
- **In Opportunity Assessment:** Understand why opportunities exist
- **In Problem Framing:** Ensure you're solving the real problem, not symptoms

## How Might We (HMW) Questions

**When to Use:** Reframing problems as opportunities.

**Format:** "How might we [action] so that [benefit]?"

**Characteristics of Good HMWs:**

- Optimistic and possibility-oriented
- Solution-neutral (doesn't suggest a specific solution)
- Broad enough to generate options
- Narrow enough to be actionable

**Problem → HMW Transformation:**

```
❌ Problem: "Users are confused by our UI"
✅ HMW: "How might we help users intuitively navigate to their goals?"

❌ Problem: "Setup takes too long"
✅ HMW: "How might we help users experience value within 5 minutes?"

❌ Problem: "We need better documentation"
✅ HMW: "How might we enable users to solve problems independently?"
```

**HMW Generation Workshop:**

1. Start with problem statement (15 min)
1. Individually write HMWs (10 min)
1. Share and build on each other's (15 min)
1. Group similar HMWs (10 min)
1. Vote on most promising (10 min)
1. Select 3-5 to ideate on (immediately)

**How HMW Helps Problem-Solution Space Exploration:**

- **In Define Phase:** Bridge from problem to solution space with solution-neutral prompts
- **In Develop Phase:** Use HMWs as ideation prompts
- **In Opportunity Framing:** Reframe opportunities as actionable questions

## 📝 Quick Decision Guide

### Which Framework Should I Use?

**Use Double Diamond when:**

- ✅ Major product initiative (new product, major feature)
- ✅ Clear start and end needed
- ✅ Cross-functional team needs structure
- ✅ Stakeholders need visibility into process
- ✅ You have 6-12 week dedicated time

**Use Opportunity Solution Tree when:**

- ✅ Continuous discovery practice
- ✅ Multiple opportunities to evaluate
- ✅ Want big-picture view over time
- ✅ Building product trio rhythm
- ✅ Need to show option generation

**Use Jobs to Be Done when:**

- ✅ Understanding motivation and context
- ✅ Exploring switching moments
- ✅ Identifying competition (not just direct competitors)
- ✅ Strategic positioning questions
- ✅ Finding unmet needs in market

**Use Five Whys when:**

- ✅ Symptoms vs. root causes unclear
- ✅ Quick problem diagnosis needed
- ✅ Team has different hypotheses
- ✅ You're solving same problem repeatedly
- ✅ 15-30 minute exercise needed

**Use How Might We when:**

- ✅ Need to reframe problems positively
- ✅ Kickstarting ideation sessions
- ✅ Moving from problem to solution space
- ✅ Breaking down large problems
- ✅ Creating generative prompts
