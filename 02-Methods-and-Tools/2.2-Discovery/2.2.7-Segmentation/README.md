# Segmentation

## What this is

Segmentation is the process of grouping customers by the **job they are trying to do** (and context, forces, outcomes), not by demographics. It bridges JTBD research and execution: you use segments to decide what to build, who to serve first, and how to position; then you create personas from priority segments for marketing and design.

**Core idea:** Segment by jobs, not by who people are. The same person can be in different segments for different jobs; different demographics can be in the same segment when the job is the same.

## When to use

- **After JTBD research** — You have 15–30+ job stories and need to group them into 3–5 actionable segments.
- **Before personas** — Define segments first (strategy); create personas for priority segments (execution).
- **When deciding who to serve** — Different segments need different features, messaging, or pricing; segmentation makes that explicit.

## When not to use

- No job research yet → Use [2.2.3-Jobs-To-Be-Done](../2.2.3-Jobs-To-Be-Done/README.md) first.
- Only prioritizing between initiatives → Use [2.1.2/4-Prioritization](../../2.1-Strategy/2.1.2-Strategic-Execution/4-Prioritization/).
- Optimizing by usage only (e.g. power vs casual users) → Use behavioral signals and [2.3.6-Metrics](../../2.3-Execution/2.3.6-Metrics/); segmentation framework mentions this briefly.

## Files

- **1-segmentation-framework.md** — Process (job clustering → definition → validation → personas), principles, example, red flags, links to other frameworks.
- **2-segment-definition-template.md** — One template per segment: job, context, forces, sizing, competition, implications, validation summary, clustering dimensions.

## Quick flow

1. **Cluster jobs** from JTBD output into 3–5 segments (use dimensions in the template).
2. **Define each segment** with the template (job, forces, who has it, competition, implications).
3. **Validate** qualitatively (and quantitatively if possible); revise or merge as needed.
4. **Prioritize** which 1–2 segments to serve (use existing Prioritization framework).
5. **Create personas** for those segments via [2.3.5-Personas](../../2.3-Execution/2.3.5-Personas/README.md).

## How this fits in Discovery

- **JTBD (2.2.3)** → job stories and forces.
- **Segmentation (2.2.7)** → group jobs into segments; define and validate.
- **Problem-Solution Space (2.2.6)** → validate which problems matter to which segments.
- **PMF (2.2.8)** → assess fit by segment when relevant.
- **Personas (2.3.5)** → execution artifacts from priority segments.

## Braindump first

Before opening the template, braindump: What customer groups do you keep hearing about? What jobs feel meaningfully different? What would "different enough to matter" look like? Then use the framework and template to structure your thinking.
