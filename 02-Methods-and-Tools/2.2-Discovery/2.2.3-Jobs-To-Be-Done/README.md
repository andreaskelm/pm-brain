# Jobs To Be Done Framework

## Introduction

Use this framework to understand the underlying jobs customers hire your product to do, focusing on progress rather than demographics. JTBD helps you understand why customers choose your product and what progress they're trying to make.

**When to use JTBD:**
- Understanding why customers choose your product over alternatives
- Reframing feature requests as customer progress
- Identifying unmet customer needs
- Designing solutions centered on customer jobs

**When JTBD might not be needed:**
- Technical infrastructure work with no direct customer impact
- Internal tooling where the "job" is obvious
- Very early exploration before customer understanding exists

## Before Using This Framework

⚠️ **Don't jump straight to job statements.**

### 1. Read the Golden Rule

**See:** [`/PRODUCT-SENSE-RULES.md`](../../../../PRODUCT-SENSE-RULES.md)

### 2. Braindump First (15 min)

**Use the prompts:** [`02-Methods-and-Tools/2.0-Foundations/2.0.1-Mental-Models/6-Product-Sense-Development/2-product-sense-template.md`](../../../../02-Methods-and-Tools/2.0-Foundations/2.0.1-Mental-Models/6-Product-Sense-Development/2-product-sense-template.md)

Specifically, the "Before Writing a PRD" section (User Understanding):
- Who is this really for?
- What are they currently doing instead? Why does that suck?
- What's the job they're hiring this feature to do?

**JTBD frameworks organize job understanding—they don't create empathy.**

### 3. Then Use This Framework

After your braindump, use JTBD to structure your understanding.

## How to Use This Framework

**Product sense exercise:**
- If you had to explain the customer's job in one sentence, what would it be?
- What would make you say "this is obviously not the job"?
- What would make you say "this is obviously the job"?

### Step 1: Identify the Job
Understand what progress customers are trying to make

### Step 2: Map Job Context
Document when, where, and why the job arises

### Step 3: Understand Alternatives
Research what customers currently hire to get the job done

### Step 4: Define Job Success
Determine how customers measure successful job completion

### Step 5: Design for Progress
Create solutions that enable the desired progress

### Step 6: Self-Reflection
After mapping jobs, reflect:
- How did your understanding of the job evolve?
- What biases did you catch? (Feature bias? Solution bias?)
- What does your product sense tell you about this job?
- What would you do differently next time?

## How to Maintain

- **After Interviews**: Update job stories as you learn more from customer research
- **Quarterly Reviews**: Reassess whether you're helping customers make progress
- **After Launches**: Validate that solutions enable job completion
