# Jobs To Be Done Framework

## Introduction

Use this framework to understand the underlying jobs customers hire your product to do, focusing on progress rather than demographics. JTBD helps you understand why customers choose your product and what progress they're trying to make.

**When to use JTBD:**
- Understanding why customers choose your product over alternatives
- Reframing feature requests as customer progress
- Identifying unmet customer needs
- Designing solutions centered on customer jobs

**When JTBD might not be needed:**
- Technical infrastructure work with no direct customer impact
- Internal tooling where the "job" is obvious
- Very early exploration before customer understanding exists

## How to Use This Framework

### Step 0: Braindump & Product Sense (Do this first!)

**Before identifying jobs, braindump:**
- What do you think customers are trying to accomplish? Dump all your thoughts.
- What does your product sense tell you? What feels like the real job?
- What biases might affect your view? (Feature bias? Solution bias?)
- What would great product sense notice? What would an experienced PM see?

**Product sense exercise:**
- If you had to explain the customer's job in one sentence, what would it be?
- What would make you say "this is obviously not the job"?
- What would make you say "this is obviously the job"?

### Step 1: Identify the Job
Understand what progress customers are trying to make

### Step 2: Map Job Context
Document when, where, and why the job arises

### Step 3: Understand Alternatives
Research what customers currently hire to get the job done

### Step 4: Define Job Success
Determine how customers measure successful job completion

### Step 5: Design for Progress
Create solutions that enable the desired progress

### Step 6: Self-Reflection
After mapping jobs, reflect:
- How did your understanding of the job evolve?
- What biases did you catch? (Feature bias? Solution bias?)
- What does your product sense tell you about this job?
- What would you do differently next time?

## How to Maintain

- **After Interviews**: Update job stories as you learn more from customer research
- **Quarterly Reviews**: Reassess whether you're helping customers make progress
- **After Launches**: Validate that solutions enable job completion
