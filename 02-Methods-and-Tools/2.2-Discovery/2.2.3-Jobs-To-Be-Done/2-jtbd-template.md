# JTBD Job File Template

Use this when creating a single job file (one per core job). Copy this into `03-Research-Artifacts/jobs/` (or an initiative folder), rename it to `job-[concise-job-handle]-[YYYY-MM-DD].md`, and fill it in based on your JTBD research.

# Job: [Clear job story]
When [situation], I want to [progress], so I can [outcome].

## Meta
- **Owner:** [Name]
- **Date:** [YYYY-MM-DD]
- **Status:** [Draft | Validating | Validated]
- **Segments:** [Primary audience(s)]
- **Evidence sources:** [Links to snapshots/interviews/data]

## Context
- **Situation/Trigger:** [When does this job arise?]
- **Constraints:** [Time, tools, compliance, environment]
- **Frequency:** [How often? Cadence? Seasonality?]

## Forces of Progress (Switch)
- **Push (from current):** [What’s not working]
- **Pull (to new):** [What’s attractive]
- **Anxieties (about new):** [Risks/unknowns]
- **Habits (status quo):** [What keeps them in place]

## Current Solutions & Workarounds
- **Primary approach:** [What they do today]
- **Alternatives:** [Other ways they handle it]
- **Failure modes:** [When/how it breaks]
- **Social/organizational context:** [Who else is involved]

## Outcome Statements (ODI-style)
- Minimize/Increase [metric] when [circumstance] while [constraint]
- Minimize/Increase [...]
- [List 5–10 clear, measurable outcomes]

## Evidence & Patterns
- **Customer stories (3+):**
  - [Story A: brief, with quote and outcome]
  - [Story B: brief, with quote and outcome]
  - [Story C: brief, with quote and outcome]
- **Quote bank:**
  > “[Verbatim that reflects job/outcome]” — [Persona/Role]
- **Pattern strength:** [Strong/Moderate/Weak] — why

## Segment Differences
- **Segment A:** [Unique context/outcomes]
- **Segment B:** [Differences in frequency/constraints]

*For systematic segmentation:* Once you have many job stories, use **2.2.7-Segmentation** to cluster jobs into 3–5 market segments (job-based, not demographic), define and validate them, then prioritize which to serve. See [2.2.7-Segmentation](../2.2.7-Segmentation/README.md).

## Opportunity Scoring
| Outcome/Need | Importance (1–10) | Satisfaction (1–10) | Opportunity = Importance + max(Importance - Satisfaction, 0) |
|--------------|-------------------|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
|              |                   |                     |                                                                |

- **Top opportunities:** [Outcomes with highest scores and evidence]
- **Risks/unknowns:** [Key assumptions to validate]

## Implications
- **For product:** [How jobs/outcomes inform scope or solution space]
- **For research:** [What to learn/test next; riskiest assumptions]
- **For business:** [Expected impact/risks]

## Links
- **Interview snapshots:** [refs]
- **Synthesis:** [ref]
- **Opportunities:** [ref to `3-create-opportunities`]
