# Continuous Discovery Habits Framework

## Introduction

Use these templates to conduct systematic customer discovery interviews and synthesize insights into actionable opportunities and solutions. This framework helps you move from raw customer conversations to validated product opportunities.

**When to use this framework:**
- Conducting customer interviews and user research
- Synthesizing patterns from multiple interviews
- Identifying product opportunities from research
- Generating solution concepts based on discovered needs

**When discovery might not be needed:**
- Well-understood problems with existing solutions
- Technical infrastructure work with no customer impact
- Very early exploration before clear problem space exists

## For Agents: When to Suggest This Framework

**Trigger conditions:**
- User mentions: "continuous discovery", "ongoing user research", "weekly interviews", "Teresa Torres", "discovery habits", "regular customer conversations"
- User is in: product_sense (during discovery braindump) or execution_mode (when user asks about ongoing discovery)
- Prerequisites: User wants to establish ongoing discovery practice (not just one-time research)
- User has: Some understanding that discovery should be continuous (may need help establishing the habit)

**How to introduce:**
- "You want to establish ongoing discovery practice with regular customer interviews. Let's use Continuous Discovery Habits to set up a systematic approach to weekly interviews and synthesis."
- "Based on your thinking about [discovery needs], let's structure ongoing discovery using this framework to continuously identify opportunities."

**Common mistakes to avoid:**
- Don't suggest Continuous Discovery Habits if user needs one-time research (suggest Research Interviews instead)
- Don't suggest this if user doesn't have capacity for weekly interviews (help them start with one-time research first)
- Don't skip braindump - discovery frameworks organize practice, they don't create curiosity
- Don't suggest this if user is exploring a specific problem (use Problem-Solution Space or Research Interviews first)
- Don't create interview snapshots without synthesis (must synthesize 3+ interviews to find patterns)

**When NOT to use Continuous Discovery Habits:**
- User needs one-time research for specific questions (use Research Interviews)
- User is exploring a specific ambiguous problem (use Problem-Solution Space frameworks)
- User doesn't have capacity for weekly interviews (start with one-time research)
- User is ready to validate solutions (use Idea Validation or Opportunity Assessment)

**Distinction from Research Interviews:**
- **Continuous Discovery Habits:** Ongoing practice, weekly interviews, continuous synthesis, opportunity identification
- **Research Interviews:** One-time or occasional research, focused questions, specific validation
- **When to use Continuous Discovery Habits:** Want ongoing discovery practice, continuous opportunity identification, weekly interview cadence
- **When to use Research Interviews:** Specific research questions, one-time validation, focused discovery project

**Cross-reference:** Continuous Discovery Habits feeds into Opportunity Assessment (discovery → opportunities) and Problem-Solution Space (ongoing discovery → problem exploration). If user completes discovery, suggest Opportunity Assessment next.

## How to Use This Framework

### Step 0: Braindump & Check Biases (Do this first!)

**Use prompts from:** [2-product-sense-prompts.md](../../../../2.0-Foundations/2.0.1-Mental-Models/6-Product-Sense-Development/2-product-sense-prompts.md) → [Before Continuous Discovery (interviews / synthesis / opportunities)](../../../../2.0-Foundations/2.0.1-Mental-Models/6-Product-Sense-Development/2-product-sense-prompts.md#before-continuous-discovery-interviews-synthesis-opportunities).

**Quick start:** Before interviews: What do you think you know? What biases might affect interviews? What would great product sense notice? Before synthesizing: What patterns do you think you're seeing? What biases might affect synthesis? Before creating opportunities: What opportunities do you think exist? What biases might be affecting your view? **See prompts file for full list.**

### Step 1: Conduct Interviews
Use `1-create-interview-snapshot.md` to capture insights from each interview.

After each interview (or small batch of interviews), consider adding a short entry in:

- `00-Meta/research-insight-log.md`

to record:
- 1–3 key learnings,
- the underlying problem/job,
- how this affects your current prioritization assumptions,
- and what genuinely surprised you.

### Step 2: Synthesize Patterns
Use `2-synthesize-interview-snapshots.md` to find patterns across 3+ interviews

### Step 3: Identify Opportunities
Use `3-create-opportunities.md` to create evidence-based opportunity documents

### Step 4: Generate Solutions
Use `4-generate-solutions.md` to develop multiple solution concepts

### Step 5: Self-Reflection
After each step, reflect:
- What did you learn? What surprised you?
- What biases did you catch yourself falling into?
- How did your product sense guide you?
- What would you do differently next time?

## How to Maintain

- **After Each Interview**: Create interview snapshot within 24 hours
- **After 3+ Interviews**: Synthesize patterns and update opportunity documents
- **Quarterly Reviews**: Review discovery effectiveness and adjust approach
