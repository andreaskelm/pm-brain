# Continuous Discovery Habits Framework

## Introduction

Use these templates to conduct systematic customer discovery interviews and synthesize insights into actionable opportunities and solutions. This framework helps you move from raw customer conversations to validated product opportunities.

**When to use this framework:**
- Conducting customer interviews and user research
- Synthesizing patterns from multiple interviews
- Identifying product opportunities from research
- Generating solution concepts based on discovered needs

**When discovery might not be needed:**
- Well-understood problems with existing solutions
- Technical infrastructure work with no customer impact
- Very early exploration before clear problem space exists

## How to Use This Framework

### Step 0: Braindump & Check Biases (Do this first!)

**Before conducting interviews, braindump:**
- What do you think you know about customers? Dump all assumptions.
- What biases might affect your interviews? (Confirmation bias? Solution bias?)
- What does your product sense tell you? What feels off or interesting?
- What would great product sense notice here? What would an experienced PM see?

**Before synthesizing, braindump:**
- What patterns do you think you're seeing? Dump your initial thoughts.
- What biases might affect your synthesis? (Pattern matching bias? Availability bias?)
- What does your gut tell you? What feels important?

**Before creating opportunities, braindump:**
- What opportunities do you think exist? Dump everything.
- What does your product sense tell you? What feels like a real opportunity?
- What biases might be affecting your view? (Solution bias? Feature bias?)

### Step 1: Conduct Interviews
Use `1-create-interview-snapshot.md` to capture insights from each interview.

After each interview (or small batch of interviews), consider adding a short entry in:

- `00-Meta/research-insight-log.md`

to record:
- 1–3 key learnings,
- the underlying problem/job,
- how this affects your current prioritization assumptions,
- and what genuinely surprised you.

### Step 2: Synthesize Patterns
Use `2-synthesize-interview-snapshots.md` to find patterns across 3+ interviews

### Step 3: Identify Opportunities
Use `3-create-opportunities.md` to create evidence-based opportunity documents

### Step 4: Generate Solutions
Use `4-generate-solutions.md` to develop multiple solution concepts

### Step 5: Self-Reflection
After each step, reflect:
- What did you learn? What surprised you?
- What biases did you catch yourself falling into?
- How did your product sense guide you?
- What would you do differently next time?

## How to Maintain

- **After Each Interview**: Create interview snapshot within 24 hours
- **After 3+ Interviews**: Synthesize patterns and update opportunity documents
- **Quarterly Reviews**: Review discovery effectiveness and adjust approach
