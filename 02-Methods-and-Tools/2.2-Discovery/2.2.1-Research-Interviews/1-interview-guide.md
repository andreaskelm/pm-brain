# Interview Guide

## Overview

This guide provides principles and best practices for conducting effective customer discovery interviews, heavily inspired by Teresa Torres' Continuous Discovery Habits methodology. Use this as a reference before, during, and after interviews to ensure high-quality research outcomes.

> **Before using this guide:** Braindump first! What do you think you know about customers? What are your assumptions? What does your product sense tell you? Then use this guide to structure your interview approach.

## How This Fits in the System

- **01-Company-Context/** – Strategic foundation and company context.  
- **02-Methods-and-Tools/** – Frameworks and methods (this interview guide lives under `2.2-Discovery/2.2.1-Research-Interviews/`).  
- **03-Research-Artifacts/** – Archive for interview notes, synthesis docs, and research findings.  
- **04-Initiatives/** – Active initiatives and opportunity assessments that link to your research.

## Before Conducting Interviews: Braindump & Product Sense

**Before preparing your interview questions, take 10-15 minutes to braindump:**

- What do you think you know about customers? Dump all assumptions.
- What does your product sense tell you? What feels off or interesting?
- What biases might affect your interviews? (Confirmation bias? Solution bias?)
- What would great product sense notice? What would an experienced PM see?
- What questions does your gut tell you to ask?

**Product sense exercise:**
- If you had to interview ONE customer and learn everything important, what would you ask?
- What would make you say "this interview is obviously going wrong"?
- What would make you say "this interview is obviously going well"?

**Then use this guide** to structure your approach and avoid common pitfalls.

## Core Principles

### 1. Focus on Past Behavior, Not Hypotheticals
- Ask about specific past experiences, not future intentions
- "Tell me about the last time you..." instead of "Would you use..."
- People are poor predictors of future behavior but accurate reporters of past actions

### 2. Seek Stories, Not Opinions
- Look for concrete examples and narratives
- Avoid leading questions that solicit opinions
- Stories reveal real needs, constraints, and motivations

### 3. Understand the Job to Be Done
- Focus on what customers are trying to accomplish
- Understand the context, constraints, and desired outcomes
- Avoid feature-focused questions

### 4. Interview Regularly, Not Just When Needed
- Build continuous discovery habits
- Interview weekly, not just during specific projects
- Maintain ongoing customer connection

## Common Biases to Avoid

### Interviewer Biases

**Confirmation Bias**
- **Problem**: Seeking information that confirms your existing beliefs
- **Solution**: Actively look for disconfirming evidence, ask open-ended questions

**Leading Questions**
- **Problem**: Unintentionally guiding interviewees toward desired answers
- **Solution**: Use neutral language, avoid suggesting answers

**Social Desirability Bias**
- **Problem**: Interviewees give answers they think you want to hear
- **Solution**: Ask about past behavior, not opinions; create safe space for honesty

**Anchoring Bias**
- **Problem**: First piece of information influences subsequent responses
- **Solution**: Vary question order, don't reveal your assumptions early

### Interviewee Biases

**Recency Bias**
- **Problem**: Overweighting recent experiences
- **Solution**: Ask about multiple past experiences, not just the most recent

**Availability Heuristic**
- **Problem**: Recalling only memorable or extreme examples
- **Solution**: Ask for specific, detailed examples; probe for typical experiences

**Hindsight Bias**
- **Problem**: Reinterpreting past events with current knowledge
- **Solution**: Focus on what they knew and felt at the time, not what they know now

## How to Ask Questions

### Question Types

**Opening Questions**
- Start broad: "Tell me about your role..." or "Walk me through a typical day..."
- Build rapport and context before diving deep
- Avoid jumping straight to your product area

**Follow-up Questions**
- "Can you tell me more about that?"
- "What happened next?"
- "How did that make you feel?"
- "What were you trying to accomplish?"

**Probing Questions**
- "Can you give me a specific example?"
- "When was the last time this happened?"
- "What was going on in your life at that time?"
- "Who else was involved?"

**Avoid These Question Types**
- ❌ Leading: "Don't you think X would be better?"
- ❌ Hypothetical: "Would you use X if we built it?"
- ❌ Feature-focused: "Do you want feature X?"
- ❌ Yes/No: "Do you have this problem?"

### Question Frameworks

**The Five Whys**
- Ask "why" five times to get to root causes
- Helps uncover underlying motivations and needs

**STAR Method (Situation, Task, Action, Result)**
- Situation: What was the context?
- Task: What were you trying to accomplish?
- Action: What did you do?
- Result: What happened?

**Jobs to Be Done Questions**
- What job were you trying to get done?
- What were the circumstances?
- What constraints were you facing?
- What would a better experience look like?

## Interview Structure

### Pre-Interview

1. **Prepare Your Questions**
   - Write open-ended questions focused on past behavior
   - Avoid leading or hypothetical questions
   - Prepare follow-up probes

2. **Set Context**
   - Explain the purpose: learning about their experiences
   - Clarify you're not selling anything
   - Get permission to record (if applicable)

3. **Review Your Assumptions**
   - List what you think you know
   - Be ready to be wrong
   - Stay curious, not defensive

### During Interview

1. **Build Rapport (5-10 minutes)**
   - Start with easy, open questions
   - Show genuine interest
   - Create comfortable environment

2. **Explore the Problem Space (20-30 minutes)**
   - Ask about past experiences
   - Seek specific examples
   - Understand context and constraints
   - Avoid jumping to solutions

3. **Understand Desired Outcomes (10-15 minutes)**
   - What would success look like?
   - What are they trying to accomplish?
   - What would make their life better?

4. **Wrap Up (5 minutes)**
   - Ask if there's anything else they want to share
   - Thank them for their time
   - Offer to share findings (if appropriate)

### Post-Interview

1. **Capture Insights Immediately**
   - Document within 24 hours while memory is fresh
   - Use your preferred interview notes template (for example in `02-Methods-and-Tools/templates/research/`) or the structure in `03-Research-Artifacts/3.1-User-Interviews/`
   - Note surprises, contradictions, and patterns

2. **Save Artifacts**
   - Save raw transcript PDFs to `3.1-User-Interviews/transcripts/`
   - Save AI-generated snapshot markdowns to `3.1-User-Interviews/snapshots/`
   - Add synthesis docs under `3.1-User-Interviews/synthesis/`

3. **Reflect on Your Biases**
   - What assumptions were confirmed?
   - What assumptions were challenged?
   - What surprised you?

## Best Practices

### Do's
- ✅ Listen more than you talk (aim for 80/20)
- ✅ Ask about specific past experiences
- ✅ Probe for details and context
- ✅ Take notes, but maintain eye contact
- ✅ Show empathy and understanding
- ✅ Follow interesting tangents
- ✅ Ask "what else?" multiple times

### Don'ts
- ❌ Don't pitch your product or solution
- ❌ Don't ask hypothetical questions
- ❌ Don't interrupt or finish their sentences
- ❌ Don't defend your ideas or assumptions
- ❌ Don't ask leading questions
- ❌ Don't rush to solutions
- ❌ Don't assume you understand—ask for clarification

## Common Mistakes

1. **Talking Too Much**: You should listen 80% of the time
2. **Asking About Solutions**: Focus on problems and jobs to be done
3. **Ignoring Contradictions**: When someone says one thing but does another, explore it
4. **Not Probing Deep Enough**: Surface-level answers don't reveal real needs
5. **Confirmation Seeking**: Only hearing what confirms your beliefs
6. **Rushing**: Good interviews take time; don't rush to cover everything
