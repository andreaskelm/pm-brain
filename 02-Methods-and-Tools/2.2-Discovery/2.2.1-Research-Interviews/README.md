# Research Interviews Guide

## For Agents: When to Suggest Research Interviews

**Trigger conditions:**
- User mentions: "user research", "customer interviews", "talk to users", "interview customers", "user feedback", "need to understand users"
- User is in: product_sense (during discovery braindump) or execution_mode (when user asks to do research)
- Prerequisites: User has assumptions/questions about users that need validation
- User has: Some initial thinking about what they want to learn (may need help clarifying research questions)

**How to introduce:**
- "You want to understand your users better through research interviews. Let's use the Research Interviews guide to structure your approach and ask the right questions."
- "Based on your thinking about [assumptions/questions], let's plan research interviews to validate what you know and discover what you don't."

**Common mistakes to avoid:**
- Don't suggest Research Interviews if user already has sufficient data (help them synthesize existing research first)
- Don't suggest Research Interviews if user is asking "how do I build X" without understanding "why" (help them understand the problem first)
- Don't skip braindump - research guides organize questions, they don't create curiosity
- Don't suggest Research Interviews if user needs ongoing discovery (suggest Continuous Discovery Habits instead)
- Don't create leading questions (focus on past behavior, not future intentions)

**When NOT to use Research Interviews:**
- User already has sufficient user data (help them synthesize or use existing research)
- User needs ongoing discovery practice (use Continuous Discovery Habits)
- User is ready to validate solutions (use Idea Validation or Opportunity Assessment)
- User is exploring problem space (use Problem-Solution Space frameworks first)

**Distinction from Continuous Discovery Habits:**
- **Research Interviews:** One-time or occasional research projects (focused research, specific questions)
- **Continuous Discovery Habits:** Ongoing discovery practice (weekly interviews, continuous synthesis)
- **When to use Research Interviews:** Specific research questions, one-time validation, focused discovery project
- **When to use Continuous Discovery Habits:** Ongoing discovery practice, continuous opportunity identification, weekly interview cadence

**Cross-reference:** Research Interviews often feed into JTBD (interviews → job stories), Opportunity Assessment (research → validated opportunities), or Continuous Discovery Habits (one-time research → ongoing practice).

## Introduction

This guide helps product teams conduct effective user research interviews that uncover real customer needs, pain points, and opportunities. Research interviews are NOT sales calls or feature requests—they're discovery tools to understand what customers are trying to accomplish.

## Before Using This Guide

⚠️ **Don't jump straight to interview scripts.**

### 1. Read the Golden Rule

**See:** [`/PRODUCT-SENSE-RULES.md`](../../../../PRODUCT-SENSE-RULES.md)

### 2. Braindump First (15 min)

**Use the prompts:** [`02-Methods-and-Tools/2.0-Foundations/2.0.1-Mental-Models/6-Product-Sense-Development/2-product-sense-prompts.md`](../../../../02-Methods-and-Tools/2.0-Foundations/2.0.1-Mental-Models/6-Product-Sense-Development/2-product-sense-prompts.md)

Specifically, the "Before User Research / Discovery" section:
- What question keeps me up at night about our users?
- What assumption, if wrong, would completely change our plans?
- What am I hoping NOT to hear? (Red flag - investigate this)

**Interview guides organize questions—they don't create curiosity.**

### 3. Log the Insights (Optional but Recommended)

Right after interviews, capture the most important learnings in your **research & insight log**:

- **Log file:** `00-Meta/research-insight-log.md`
- **What to capture:** 1–3 key learnings, the underlying problem/job, how this supports or challenges your current assumptions, and what surprised you.

This creates a lightweight evidence trail you can reuse later for prioritization, PRDs, and strategy debates.

### 4. Then Use This Guide

After your braindump (and optional log entry), use the guide to structure your research.

## How to Use This Guide

### Step 1: Review Guide
Read `1-interview-guide.md` to understand interview principles and question frameworks

### Step 2: Prepare Interview Script
Create your interview script based on what you're trying to learn

### Step 3: Recruit Participants
Identify and recruit appropriate participants

### Step 4: Conduct Interviews
Follow the guide's best practices during interviews

### Step 5: Synthesize Learnings
Use synthesis methods to identify patterns and insights

## When to Use

- Understanding customer problems
- Validating assumptions
- Exploring new opportunities
- Understanding user behavior
- Gathering feedback on existing products
