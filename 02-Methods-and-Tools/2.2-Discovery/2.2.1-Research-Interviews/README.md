# Research Interviews Guide

## Introduction

This guide helps product teams conduct effective user research interviews that uncover real customer needs, pain points, and opportunities. Research interviews are NOT sales calls or feature requests—they're discovery tools to understand what customers are trying to accomplish.

## Before Using This Guide

⚠️ **Don't jump straight to interview scripts.**

### 1. Read the Golden Rule

**See:** [`/PRODUCT-SENSE-RULES.md`](../../../../PRODUCT-SENSE-RULES.md)

### 2. Braindump First (15 min)

**Use the prompts:** [`02-Methods-and-Tools/2.0-Foundations/2.0.1-Mental-Models/6-Product-Sense-Development/2-product-sense-prompts.md`](../../../../02-Methods-and-Tools/2.0-Foundations/2.0.1-Mental-Models/6-Product-Sense-Development/2-product-sense-prompts.md)

Specifically, the "Before User Research / Discovery" section:
- What question keeps me up at night about our users?
- What assumption, if wrong, would completely change our plans?
- What am I hoping NOT to hear? (Red flag - investigate this)

**Interview guides organize questions—they don't create curiosity.**

### 3. Log the Insights (Optional but Recommended)

Right after interviews, capture the most important learnings in your **research & insight log**:

- **Log file:** `00-Meta/research-insight-log.md`
- **What to capture:** 1–3 key learnings, the underlying problem/job, how this supports or challenges your current assumptions, and what surprised you.

This creates a lightweight evidence trail you can reuse later for prioritization, PRDs, and strategy debates.

### 4. Then Use This Guide

After your braindump (and optional log entry), use the guide to structure your research.
