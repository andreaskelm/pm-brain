# 2.2 – Discovery Overview

This domain contains methods for understanding customers, framing opportunities, and validating ideas.

## Before Using Any Discovery Framework

⚠️ **Don't jump straight to research plans.**

### 1. Read the Golden Rule

**See:** [PRODUCT-SENSE-RULES.md](../../PRODUCT-SENSE-RULES.md) (repo root)

### 2. Braindump First (10-15 min)

**Use the prompts:** [2-product-sense-prompts.md](../2.0-Foundations/2.0.1-Mental-Models/6-Product-Sense-Development/2-product-sense-prompts.md) — "Before User Research / Discovery" section.  
**Or start from the entry point:** [0-start-here-product-thinking.md](../2.0-Foundations/2.0.1-Mental-Models/6-Product-Sense-Development/0-start-here-product-thinking.md) (simple prompt for a product-thinking chat).

Specifically, the "Before User Research / Discovery" section:
- What assumption, if wrong, would completely change our plans?
- What am I hoping NOT to hear? (Red flag - investigate this)
- What evidence would change my mind?

**Discovery frameworks guide your learning—they don't replace thinking.**

### 3. Then Use Discovery Frameworks

After your braindump, use the frameworks below to structure your research.

---

## Discovery Frameworks

- **2.2.1-Research-Interviews**  
  Interview guide and best practices. Use this before and during interviews to avoid bias, ask better questions, and capture richer stories.

- **2.2.2-Continuous-Discovery-Habits**  
  End-to-end discovery flow: create interview snapshots, synthesize patterns, create opportunities, and generate solutions. Use this when you want a repeatable weekly discovery rhythm.

- **2.2.3-Jobs-To-Be-Done**  
  Framework for capturing jobs, outcomes, and context. Use this when you need to reframe solution requests into underlying jobs and desired progress.

- **2.2.4-Opportunity-Assessment**  
  Framework for documenting early initiative thinking, capturing hypotheses, and identifying what needs validation. Use this to structure your thinking before committing to build.

- **2.2.5-Idea-Validation**  
  Framework for reducing risk before build (RAT-style validation). Use this when stakeholders say "prove it" and you need a minimal test plan for desirability, usability, feasibility, or viability.

- **2.2.6-Problem-Solution-Space**  
  Framework for systematically exploring ambiguous problems and generating multiple solution options. Use this when you need to deeply understand a problem before committing to a solution.

- **2.2.7-Segmentation**  
  Framework for grouping customers by the job they are trying to do (not demographics). Use after JTBD research to cluster job stories into 3–5 segments, then define and validate; segments drive strategy, personas (2.3.5) drive execution.

- **2.2.8-Product-Market-Fit**  
  Framework for understanding and achieving product-market fit. Use this to assess PMF status, validate market demand, and decide when to scale vs. iterate.

Typical flow: **Research-Interviews → Continuous-Discovery-Habits → JTBD (optional/parallel) → Segmentation (after JTBD) → Problem-Solution-Space → Opportunity-Assessment → Idea-Validation → Product-Market-Fit → Strategy/Execution**.
