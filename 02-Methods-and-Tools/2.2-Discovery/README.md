# 2.2 – Discovery Overview

This domain contains methods for understanding customers, framing opportunities, and validating ideas.

**Before using any discovery framework:**
1. **Braindump first** – What do you think you know? What are your assumptions? Dump everything.
2. **Check your biases** – What biases might be affecting your view? Confirmation bias? Solution bias?
3. **Use product sense** – What does your intuition tell you? What feels off or interesting?
4. **Think critically** – Challenge your assumptions. What evidence do you actually have?
5. **Reflect** – After discovery, reflect on what surprised you and how your thinking changed

- **2.2.1-Research-Interviews**  
  Interview guide and best practices. Use this before and during interviews to avoid bias, ask better questions, and capture richer stories.

- **2.2.2-Continuous-Discovery-Habits**  
  End-to-end discovery flow: create interview snapshots, synthesize patterns, create opportunities, and generate solutions. Use this when you want a repeatable weekly discovery rhythm.

- **2.2.3-Jobs-To-Be-Done**  
  Framework for capturing jobs, outcomes, and context. Use this when you need to reframe solution requests into underlying jobs and desired progress.

- **2.2.4-Opportunity-Assessment**  
  Framework for documenting early initiative thinking, capturing hypotheses, and identifying what needs validation. Use this to structure your thinking before committing to build.

- **2.2.5-Idea-Validation**  
  Framework for reducing risk before build (RAT-style validation). Use this when stakeholders say "prove it" and you need a minimal test plan for desirability, usability, feasibility, or viability.

- **2.2.6-Problem-Solution-Space**  
  Framework for systematically exploring ambiguous problems and generating multiple solution options. Use this when you need to deeply understand a problem before committing to a solution.

- **2.2.7-Product-Market-Fit**  
  Framework for understanding and achieving product-market fit. Use this to assess PMF status, validate market demand, and decide when to scale vs. iterate.

Typical flow: **Research-Interviews → Continuous-Discovery-Habits → JTBD (optional/parallel) → Problem-Solution-Space → Opportunity-Assessment → Idea-Validation → Product-Market-Fit → Strategy/Execution**.
