# Idea Validation Framework

## Introduction

Use this framework to systematically validate product ideas before significant investment, reducing risk and increasing success rates. The RAT (Riskiest Assumption Test) approach helps you test assumptions with minimal investment.

**When to use validation:**
- Before building significant features or products
- When stakeholders ask "prove it" before investment
- Testing desirability, usability, feasibility, or viability risks
- Reducing uncertainty before committing resources

**When validation might not be needed:**
- Very small experiments (<1 week effort)
- Well-validated problems with proven solutions
- Technical spikes where feasibility is the only risk

## How to Use This Framework

### Step 0: Braindump & Check Biases (Do this first!)

**Before forming hypotheses, braindump:**
- What do you think is true about this idea? Dump all assumptions.
- What does your product sense tell you? What feels risky?
- What biases might affect your validation? (Confirmation bias? Sunk cost? Overconfidence?)
- What would great product sense notice? What would an experienced PM test first?

**Product sense exercise:**
- If this idea is going to fail, how will it fail? What's the most likely failure mode?
- What would make you say "this is obviously not worth validating"?
- What would make you say "this is obviously worth validating"?

### Step 1: Form Hypotheses
Identify your riskiest assumptions (Desirability, Usability, Feasibility, Viability)

### Step 2: Design Tests
Create lightweight experiments to test each assumption

### Step 3: Set Thresholds
Define clear pass/fail criteria before running tests

### Step 4: Run Tests
Execute experiments and collect evidence

### Step 5: Make Decisions
Use evidence to decide Proceed/Pivot/Re-test/Stop

### Step 6: Self-Reflection
After validation, reflect:
- What did you learn? What surprised you?
- What biases did you catch? (Confirmation? Overconfidence?)
- How did your product sense guide you?
- What would you do differently next time?

## How to Maintain

- **During Validation**: Update confidence levels as you learn
- **After Tests**: Document results and decisions in decision log
- **Quarterly Reviews**: Review validation effectiveness and adjust approach
