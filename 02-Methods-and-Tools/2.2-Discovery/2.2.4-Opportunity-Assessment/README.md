# Opportunity Assessment Framework

## Before Using This Framework

⚠️ **Don't jump straight to the template.**

### 1. Read the Golden Rule

**See:** [`/PRODUCT-SENSE-RULES.md`](../../../../PRODUCT-SENSE-RULES.md)

### 2. Braindump First (15-20 min)

**Use prompts from:** [`2-product-sense-prompts.md`](../../../../2.0-Foundations/2.0.1-Mental-Models/6-Product-Sense-Development/2-product-sense-prompts.md) → "Before User Research / Discovery" section (and "Before Writing a PRD" if you're moving toward execution).

**Quick start (top 3-4 questions):**
- Who is this really for?
- What job are they hiring this to do?
- What assumptions am I making?
- What evidence would change my mind?

**See prompts file for full list.** Opportunity assessments organize hypotheses—they don't create insights.

### 3. Then Use This Framework

After your braindump, use the templates to structure your assessment.

## Introduction

Use this framework to document early initiative thinking, capture hypotheses, and identify what needs validation before moving to execution. An opportunity assessment helps you structure your thinking, identify assumptions, and plan research before committing to build.

**When to use this framework:**
- You have an initial idea or hypothesis for a new product/feature
- You need to structure early thinking before gathering evidence
- You want to identify what you know vs. what needs research
- You're preparing to move from idea to discovery validation
- You've discovered opportunities through research and need to assess them

**When opportunity assessment might not be needed:**
- Well-validated opportunities with existing evidence
- Small incremental improvements to existing features
- Technical infrastructure work with clear requirements

## Files
- `1-opportunity-assessment-framework.md` — Complete framework guide with principles and process
- `2-opportunity-assessment-template.md` — Template for documenting opportunity assessments

## How to Use This Framework

1. **Start Early**: Create opportunity assessment when you have an initial idea or hypothesis
2. **Document What You Know**: Fill out sections with current knowledge; mark unknowns explicitly
3. **Identify Research Needs**: Use "What we should research" section to plan validation
4. **Move to Discovery**: When ready, use discovery methods in this domain (e.g., `../2.2.1-Research-Interviews/`, `../2.2.2-Continuous-Discovery-Habits/`) to validate assumptions
5. **Update as You Learn**: Return to update opportunity assessment with new evidence
6. **Transition to Execution**: When validated, create PRD using templates in `../../2.3-Execution/2.3.4-PRD/`

## How This Fits in the System

**Early Thinking (04-Initiatives/):**
- Use this framework to create `opportunity-assessment.md` in your initiative folder
- Document hypotheses and assumptions before validation

**Discovery Frameworks (2.2-Discovery/):**
- Use `2.2.1-Research-Interviews/` to validate assumptions
- Use `2.2.2-Continuous-Discovery-Habits/` to synthesize evidence
- Use `2.2.3-Jobs-To-Be-Done/` to frame problems
- Use `2.2.5-Idea-Validation/` to test solutions

**Strategy & Delivery:**
- Use `../../2.3-Execution/README.md` (PRD templates) when ready to specify requirements
- Use `../../2.1-Strategy/README.md` (Roadmap) to plan execution timeline

## How to Maintain

- **Weekly Updates**: Update as you learn new information or make decisions
- **After Discovery**: Update with evidence from interviews and research
- **After Validation**: Update with validation results and next steps
- **Archive**: Move completed assessments to archive when initiative completes
