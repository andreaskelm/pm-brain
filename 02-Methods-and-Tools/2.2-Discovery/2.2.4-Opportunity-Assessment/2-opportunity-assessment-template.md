# [Initiative Working Title] – Opportunity Assessment

> **How to use:** Copy this template to your initiative folder in `04-Initiatives/[INIT-CODE]/opportunity-assessment.md` and fill it out. Update as you learn.

## Objective

- What outcome are we trying to achieve and why now?
- Business value hypothesis (e.g., revenue, risk reduction, cost, speed).
- Time horizon and exit criteria (what "good" looks like).

## Target Customer

- Primary customer/user segment and context (JTBD, key workflows).
- Stakeholders impacted (internal/external) and success definition for each.
- Where/how we'll reach them (channels, touchpoints).

## Success Metrics

- **Leading indicators:**
  - [Metric] — baseline: [x], target: [y] by [date]
- **Lagging outcomes:**
  - [Metric] — baseline: [x], target: [y] by [date]
- **Guardrails** (e.g., compliance, risk appetite, experience thresholds).

## What We Know

- Facts and evidence (link sources: data, interviews, prior initiatives).
- Constraints (regulatory, technical, operational, capacity).
- Assumptions with confidence level (e.g., High/Med/Low):
  - [Assumption 1] — [High/Med/Low]
  - [Assumption 2] — [High/Med/Low]

## What We Should Research

- **Key questions/hypotheses to validate:**
  - [Question 1]
  - [Question 2]
- **Methods** (interviews, data analysis, discovery experiments, prototypes).
- **Participants, sample size, and timeline.**
- **Decision criteria** (what would change our mind; kill/pivot/commit thresholds):
  - **Kill if:** [condition]
  - **Pivot if:** [condition]
  - **Commit if:** [condition]

## Solution Ideas

- **Concept 1:** [one-liner] — first slice MVP scope.
- **Concept 2:** [one-liner] — alternative approach.
- **Out of scope** (for now) to protect focus.

## Risks and Questions to Validate

- **Desirability** (customer value, adoption risks).
- **Viability** (commercial model, business impact, go-to-market).
- **Feasibility/Tech** (integration, scalability, data availability).
- **Usability** (flow, UX, accessibility).
- **Compliance/Legal** (market rules, privacy, auditability).
- **Dependencies** (teams, vendors, data sources, timelines).
- **Unknowns/Red flags** and how we'll de-risk.
