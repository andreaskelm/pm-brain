# Product Metrics Framework

## Introduction

This framework helps product teams distinguish between meaningful metrics and misleading ones, ensuring you measure what actually drives your product and business forward. Metrics are NOT status symbols—they're strategic tools for decision-making.

## How to Use This Framework

### Step 0: Braindump & Think First (Critical!)

**Before defining metrics, braindump:**
- What outcomes are you trying to achieve? Dump everything - don't structure yet.
- What does your product sense tell you? What metrics feel meaningful?
- What assumptions are you making about what to measure?
- What biases might affect your metric choices? (Vanity metrics? Activity bias?)

**Product sense exercise:**
- If you had to pick ONE metric that matters most, what would it be? Why?
- What would make you say "these metrics are obviously wrong"?
- What would make you say "these metrics are obviously right"?

### Step 1: Review Framework
