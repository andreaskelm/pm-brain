## 2.9 – Other Methods Overview

This domain collects supporting methods that cut across strategy, discovery, delivery, and communication.

- **2.9.1-Mental-Models**  
  Decision-making and thinking tools (e.g. pre-mortems, 60/30/10, alignment checks). Use these when you need to clarify decisions, surface risks, or align stakeholders on trade-offs.

- **2.9.2-Self-Reflection**  
  Framework for reflecting on your work, developing product sense, and catching biases. Use this after completing any framework or process to learn and improve.

- **2.9.3-Daily-Execution-And-Rituals**  
  Step-by-step guides for day-to-day PM execution in large organizations. Includes daily, weekly, and monthly rituals and routines.

- **2.9.4-Bias**  
  Framework for recognizing and mitigating cognitive biases in product decision-making. Use this to improve decision quality and catch systematic thinking errors.

- **2.9.5-Metrics**  
  Framework for distinguishing between meaningful and misleading metrics. Use this to ensure you measure what actually drives product and business forward.

- **2.9.6-Kano-Model**  
  Framework for classifying features by customer satisfaction impact (Basic Needs, Performance Needs, Delight Needs). Use this for feature prioritization and understanding user expectations.

- **2.9.7-AARRR-Pirate-Metrics**  
  Growth funnel framework (Acquisition, Activation, Retention, Revenue, Referral). Use this to measure product growth and identify funnel

As you develop additional cross-cutting methods that don't fit neatly into Strategy, Communication, or Discovery, you can add new `2.9.x-*` folders here.
