# 2.3 – Execution Methods Overview

This domain contains the frameworks you use to execute product work: daily operations, requirements definition, user understanding, prioritization, and measurement. These are the "how to build it" methods that bridge strategy and discovery into actual delivery.

**Who this is for / when you're here**
- **Junior PMs:** Learn structured approaches to writing requirements, prioritizing work, and measuring outcomes. Start with Daily Execution & Rituals and User Stories.
- **Senior PMs:** Use these frameworks to scale execution, delegate effectively, and maintain quality standards. Focus on Backlog Prioritization and Metrics.

## Before using anything here (recommended)
- Braindump: What are you trying to execute? Dump everything first.
- Product sense: What feels right/wrong about this execution challenge?
- Bias check: What biases might be affecting you? (Feature factory bias? Activity bias? Vanity metrics?)
- Reflection: What would make this obviously right/wrong?

## How this is organized

- `2.3.1-Daily-Execution-And-Rituals/` — Daily/weekly routines, context switching, common scenarios. **Use when:** Setting up your PM operating system, feeling overwhelmed, managing multiple initiatives.

- `2.3.2-User-Stories/` — Writing user stories with INVEST criteria. **Use when:** Breaking down features into development tasks, planning sprints, communicating requirements.

- `2.3.3-Backlog-Prioritization/` — Systematic backlog prioritization using RICE, ICE, Value/Effort, Severity×Frequency. **Use when:** Sprint planning, quarterly planning, stakeholder negotiations, continuous refinement.

- `2.3.4-PRD/` — Product Requirements Documents. **Use when:** After solution validation, for initiatives requiring >2 weeks effort, when cross-functional alignment is critical.

- `2.3.5-Personas/` — HEART and JOBS personas. **Use when:** Understanding user segments, making decisions when you can't talk to every user, aligning teams around user understanding.

- `2.3.6-Metrics/` — Distinguishing meaningful metrics from vanity metrics. **Use when:** Setting up measurement framework, defining success metrics, quarterly metric audits.

- `2.3.7-AARRR-Pirate-Metrics/` — Growth funnel framework (Acquisition, Activation, Retention, Revenue, Referral). **Use when:** Setting up analytics for growth products, identifying funnel bottlenecks, growth strategy planning.

## Typical flows

**Discovery → Execution Flow:**
```
Opportunity Assessment → Idea Validation → PRD → User Stories → Backlog Prioritization → (Delivery)
```

**Daily Execution Flow:**
```
Daily Rituals → Weekly Cadence → Context Switching → (Common Scenarios as needed)
```

**Measurement Flow:**
```
North Star → Metrics Framework → AARRR → (OKRs/Roadmap updates)
```

**Persona-Driven Flow:**
```
Research Interviews → Personas → PRD → User Stories → (Delivery)
```

- **Discovery (2.2-Discovery/):** Opportunity Assessment and Idea Validation feed into PRDs, Jobs-to-Be-Done informs User Stories and Personas
- **Communication (2.4-Communication/):** Stakeholder Management, Meeting Agendas, and Newsletter support daily execution
- **Foundations (2.0-Foundations/):** Mental Models (Outcome vs Output, Feature Factory), Self-Reflection, and Bias awareness support all execution work

## Maintenance notes

- Keep "How this is organized" and "When to use what" current.
- Update flows when frameworks are added/removed.
- Add/remove "Before using…" prompts if the domain needs them.
