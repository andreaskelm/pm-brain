# 2.3 – Execution Methods Overview

This domain contains the frameworks you use to execute product work: daily operations, requirements definition, user understanding, prioritization, and measurement. These are the "how to build it" methods that bridge strategy and discovery into actual delivery.

## Before Using Any Execution Framework

⚠️ **Don't jump straight to PRDs or templates.**

### 1. Read the Golden Rule

**See:** [PRODUCT-SENSE-RULES.md](../../PRODUCT-SENSE-RULES.md) (repo root)

### 2. Braindump First (10–15 min)

**Use the prompts:** [2-product-sense-prompts.md](../2.0-Foundations/2.0.1-Mental-Models/6-Product-Sense-Development/2-product-sense-prompts.md) — "Before Writing a PRD / Feature" (and situation-specific red flags).  
**Or start from the entry point:** [0-start-here-product-thinking.md](../2.0-Foundations/2.0.1-Mental-Models/6-Product-Sense-Development/0-start-here-product-thinking.md) (simple prompt for a product-thinking chat).

**Execution frameworks structure delivery—they don't replace thinking.**

### 3. Then Use Execution Frameworks

After your braindump, use the frameworks below to structure your work.

---

**Who this is for / when you're here**
- **Junior PMs:** Learn structured approaches to writing requirements, prioritizing work, and measuring outcomes. Start with Daily Execution & Rituals and User Stories.
- **Senior PMs:** Use these frameworks to scale execution, delegate effectively, and maintain quality standards. Focus on Backlog Prioritization and Metrics.

## How this is organized

- `2.3.1-Daily-Execution-And-Rituals/` — Daily/weekly routines, context switching, common scenarios. **Use when:** Setting up your PM operating system, feeling overwhelmed, managing multiple initiatives.

- `2.3.2-User-Stories/` — Writing user stories with INVEST criteria. **Use when:** Breaking down features into development tasks, planning sprints, communicating requirements.

- `2.3.3-Backlog-Prioritization/` — Systematic backlog prioritization using RICE, ICE, Value/Effort, Severity×Frequency. **Use when:** Sprint planning, quarterly planning, stakeholder negotiations, continuous refinement.

- `2.3.4-PRD/` — Product Requirements Documents. **Use when:** After solution validation, for initiatives requiring >2 weeks effort, when cross-functional alignment is critical.

- `2.3.5-Personas/` — HEART and JOBS personas. **Use when:** Understanding user segments, making decisions when you can't talk to every user, aligning teams around user understanding.

- `2.3.6-Metrics/` — Distinguishing meaningful metrics from vanity metrics. **Use when:** Setting up measurement framework, defining success metrics, quarterly metric audits.

- `2.3.7-AARRR-Pirate-Metrics/` — Growth funnel framework (Acquisition, Activation, Retention, Revenue, Referral). **Use when:** Setting up analytics for growth products, identifying funnel bottlenecks, growth strategy planning.

## Typical flows

**Discovery → Execution Flow:**
```
Opportunity Assessment → Idea Validation → PRD → User Stories → Backlog Prioritization → (Delivery)
```

**Daily Execution Flow:**
```
Daily Rituals → Weekly Cadence → Context Switching → (Common Scenarios as needed)
```

**Measurement Flow:**
```
North Star → Metrics Framework → AARRR → (OKRs/Roadmap updates)
```

**Persona-Driven Flow:**
```
Research Interviews → Personas → PRD → User Stories → (Delivery)
```

| Breaking features into stories | `2.3.2-User-Stories/` | INVEST criteria and splitting patterns |
| Prioritizing backlog items | `2.3.3-Backlog-Prioritization/` | Systematic scoring and stack ranking |
| Writing requirements | `2.3.4-PRD/` | Comprehensive requirements documentation |
| Understanding users | `2.3.5-Personas/` | HEART and JOBS persona frameworks |
| Defining success metrics | `2.3.6-Metrics/` | Avoid vanity metrics, focus on meaningful measurement |

- **Strategy (../2.1-Strategy/README.md):** OKRs define outcomes to optimize for, Roadmap shows public view of priorities, Strategic Foundations inform execution decisions
- **Discovery (../2.2-Discovery/README.md):** Opportunity Assessment and Idea Validation feed into PRDs, Jobs-to-Be-Done informs User Stories and Personas
- **Communication (../2.4-Communication/README.md):** Stakeholder Management, Meeting Agendas, and Newsletter support daily execution
- **Template Structure:** `../0-Template-Structure/` (for creating new frameworks)

## Maintenance notes

- Keep "How this is organized" and "When to use what" current.
- Update flows when frameworks are added/removed.
- Add/remove "Before using…" prompts if the domain needs them.
