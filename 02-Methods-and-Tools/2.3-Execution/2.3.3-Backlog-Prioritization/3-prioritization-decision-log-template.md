# Prioritization Decision Log Template

Use this template to document prioritization decisions, trade-offs, and rationale. Create a new log entry after each major prioritization session (sprint planning, quarterly planning, or when significant changes occur).

```markdown
# Backlog Prioritization - [Date]

## Context
- **OKRs this quarter:** [List]
- **Strategic focus:** [What we're optimizing for]
- **Capacity:** [Team size, sprint length]
- **Constraints:** [Deadlines, dependencies]

## Top 10 Items

| Rank | Item | Type | Score | Why Now |
|------|------|------|-------|---------|
| 1 | [Item] | [Type] | [Score] | [Rationale] |
| 2 | [Item] | [Type] | [Score] | [Rationale] |
| ... | | | | |

## Major Changes from Last Prioritization
- [Item X] moved from #15 → #3 because [reason]
- [Item Y] deprioritized from #5 → #20 because [reason]

## Trade-offs Made
- To do [Item A], we're NOT doing [Item B] because [rationale]
- To do [Item C], we're delaying [Item D] until [timeline]

## Stakeholder Decisions
- [Stakeholder] requested [Item], scored as [score], placed at [rank]
- [Stakeholder] escalated [Item], reviewed trade-offs, decided [outcome]

## Next Review
- **When:** [Date]
- **Triggers for early review:** [Major strategy change, new data, etc.]
```

## How to Use

1. Create a new decision log entry after each prioritization session
2. Document top 10 items with scores and rationale
3. Track changes from previous prioritization to show evolution
4. Explicitly document trade-offs to make decisions transparent
5. Record stakeholder interactions and outcomes
6. Set review cadence and triggers for early review

## When to Create a New Log Entry

- **Sprint Planning**: Document sprint priorities
- **Quarterly Planning**: Document quarterly roadmap priorities
- **Major Re-prioritization**: When strategy changes or significant new information emerges
- **Stakeholder Negotiations**: After resolving prioritization conflicts
