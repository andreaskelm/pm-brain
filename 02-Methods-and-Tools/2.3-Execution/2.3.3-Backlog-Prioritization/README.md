# Backlog Prioritization Framework

## Introduction

This framework helps you prioritize your product backlog using a systematic approach that combines strategic alignment, customer value, and practical constraints. Backlog prioritization translates strategic priorities into an ordered list of work items that teams can execute against.

## Files
- `1-backlog-prioritization-framework.md` — Complete backlog prioritization framework with process, scoring methods, patterns, and pitfalls
- `2-backlog-item-template.md` — Template for documenting backlog items with scoring and rationale
- `3-prioritization-decision-log-template.md` — Template for logging prioritization decisions and trade-offs

## How to Use This Framework

### Step 0: Braindump & Product Sense (Do this first!)

**Use prompts from:** [2-product-sense-prompts.md](../../../../../2.0-Foundations/2.0.1-Mental-Models/6-Product-Sense-Development/2-product-sense-prompts.md) → [Before Making a Prioritization Decision](../../../../../2.0-Foundations/2.0.1-Mental-Models/6-Product-Sense-Development/2-product-sense-prompts.md#before-making-a-prioritization-decision).

**Quick start:** What's in your backlog? What does your product sense say should be priorities? What assumptions about value and effort? What biases might affect prioritization? **See prompts file for full list.**

**Product sense exercise:**
- If you could only build ONE thing from the backlog, what would it be? Why?
- What would make you say "this prioritization is obviously wrong"?
- What would make you say "this prioritization is obviously right"?
- Which items are you avoiding because they're hard, not because they're wrong?

### Step 1: Review Framework
Read `1-backlog-prioritization-framework.md` to understand the prioritization process and scoring methods

### Step 2: Categorize & Clean
Sort backlog items by type (Initiative, Feature, Improvement, Tech Debt, Bug) and ensure they're well-defined

### Step 3: Score Items
Apply appropriate scoring method based on item type (RICE, ICE, Value/Effort, Severity×Frequency)

### Step 4: Stack Rank & Balance
Order items within categories, then balance across strategic priorities

### Step 5: Communicate Decisions
Document prioritization rationale and share with stakeholders

### Step 6: Self-Reflection
After prioritizing, reflect:
- Do these priorities align with strategic goals?
- Are we avoiding important but hard work?
- What would you do differently?

## When to Use

- Sprint planning (immediate next items)
- Quarterly planning (3-month roadmap)
- Annual planning (strategic initiatives)
- Stakeholder negotiations (defending choices)
- Continuous refinement (ongoing backlog health)

## How to Maintain

- **Weekly**: Groom backlog, add new items, update priorities
- **Sprint Planning**: Re-prioritize top 20-30 items for next sprint
- **Quarterly**: Full backlog review aligned to OKRs and roadmap
- **As Needed**: Adjust when strategy changes or new information emerges
