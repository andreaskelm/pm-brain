# Personas Framework

## Introduction

Use these frameworks to create actionable personas that guide product decisions. HEART personas capture emotional and contextual understanding, while JOBS personas focus on the tasks customers are trying to accomplish.

**When to use personas:**
- Understanding different user segments and their needs
- Making product decisions when you can't talk to every user
- Aligning teams around shared understanding of users
- Validating feature value against user needs

**When personas might not be needed:**
- Very small user base where you know everyone
- Technical infrastructure with no direct users
- When situational context (JTBD) is more important than demographics

## How to Use This Framework

### HEART Personas
1. **Copy Template**: Create a new file named with persona (e.g., `[persona-name]-heart.md`)
2. **Fill Fields**: Use interviews, logs, or team knowledge to complete each section
3. **Keep It Actionable**: Limit each field to one sentence or 1–3 bullets
4. **Capture Emotions**: Include emotional quotes for the Emotions section
5. **Link Artifacts**: Reference data, recordings, or research under Results

### JOBS Personas
1. **Create JOBS File**: Duplicate template to create persona-specific file (e.g., `[persona-name]-jobs.md`)
2. **Phrase as Job Story**: Use interview quotes to create "When/If → I want → So I can" statements
3. **Prioritize Features**: Focus on features that improve Outcomes or remove Obstacles
4. **Map to Metrics**: Connect JOBS outcomes to measurable experiments or KPIs

## How to Maintain

- **After Interviews**: Update personas with new insights
- **Quarterly Reviews**: Revisit personas after major product changes
- **After Feature Launches**: Validate that features address persona needs

## Segments vs. Personas
- **Segments** (2.2.7-Segmentation) define *who to serve* and *what to build* (strategy). Create segments from JTBD research first.
- **Personas** (this framework) bring segments to life for execution (marketing, UX). Create 1–2 personas per *priority* segment. See [1-personas-framework.md](1-personas-framework.md) → "Segments vs. Personas."
