# Personas Framework

## Overview

This framework provides two approaches for creating personas: HEART (human-centered) and JOBS (outcome-driven). Personas help teams build empathy and make user-centered decisions.

## Step 0: Braindump & Product Sense (Do this first!)

**Use prompts from:** [2-product-sense-prompts.md](../../../../2.0-Foundations/2.0.1-Mental-Models/6-Product-Sense-Development/2-product-sense-prompts.md) → [Generic Step 0 (any framework)](../../../../2.0-Foundations/2.0.1-Mental-Models/6-Product-Sense-Development/2-product-sense-prompts.md#generic-step-0-any-framework) and [Before Writing a PRD](../../../../2.0-Foundations/2.0.1-Mental-Models/6-Product-Sense-Development/2-product-sense-prompts.md#before-writing-a-prd) (user understanding). Quick start: Who are your users? What segments matter most? What assumptions about users? What biases might affect your personas? **See prompts file for full list.**

**Product sense exercise:**
- If you had to pick ONE user type to focus on, who would it be? Why?
- What would make you say "these personas are obviously wrong"?
- What would make you say "these personas are obviously right"?

## HEART Framework

**Purpose:**
- Lightweight persona framework focused on human motivations and triggers.
- Keeps personas actionable and emotionally relatable for product decisions.

**Structure:**
- H — Human: identity, role, background, experience
- E — Emotions: motivations, frustrations, success feeling
- A — Actions: daily responsibilities, decision authority, collaboration style
- R — Results: key metrics, constraints, stakes
- T — Triggers: pain points, catalysts, blockers

**When to use:**
- Early product scoping, feature prioritization, UX conversations, stakeholder alignment.

**Notes:**
- Keep entries concise (1–3 bullet points per field).
- Update with real user data after interviews or telemetry.

-----

## JOBS Framework (Jobs-to-be-Done)

**Purpose:**
- Focuses on the core "job" the user hires a solution to complete.
- Best for discovering real user needs and outcome-driven design.

**Structure:**
- Job to be Done: the goal the user wants to achieve
- Trigger: event that makes the job urgent
- Outcome: success criteria / desired result
- Obstacles: what prevents the user from succeeding
- Context: when, where, and why the job appears

**When to use:**
- Feature ideation, prioritization, experiment design, messaging.

**Notes:**
- Capture verbs and context — JOBS is action-first.
