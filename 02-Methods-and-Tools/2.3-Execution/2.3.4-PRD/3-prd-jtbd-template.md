# Jobs-to-be-Done Product Requirements Document (JTBD-PRD)

## Introduction

This is a specialized PRD template focused on Jobs-to-Be-Done methodology. Use this template when your product work is centered around helping customers make progress on specific jobs, rather than building features.

**When to use this template:**
- Your discovery work identified clear job stories
- You want to ensure solution design is job-centered
- You need to measure job completion, not just feature usage
- Your competitive analysis focuses on job alternatives

**When to use the standard template instead:**
- Feature enhancements to existing products
- Technical infrastructure work
- When job framing isn't central to the initiative

## How to Use This Template

1. **Start with Job Definition** (Section 2): Clearly define the job before designing solutions
2. **Map Alternatives** (Section 3): Understand what customers currently hire to get the job done
3. **Define Job Success** (Section 4): Measure job completion, not just feature adoption
4. **Design for Progress** (Section 5): Ensure your solution enables the desired progress
5. **Track Job Metrics** (Section 9): Monitor job completion rates and satisfaction

## How to Maintain

- **During Development**: Update job stories and flows as you learn more
- **Post-Launch**: Track job completion metrics and iterate based on job performance
- **Quarterly Reviews**: Assess whether you're helping customers make progress on the job
