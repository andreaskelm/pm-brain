# AARRR Pirate Metrics Framework

## Introduction

Use this framework to measure and optimize product growth across five key stages: Acquisition, Activation, Retention, Revenue, and Referral. AARRR provides a funnel-based approach to understanding where users drop off and where to focus optimization efforts.

**When to use this framework:**
- Setting up analytics for growth products
- Identifying funnel bottlenecks
- Measuring product growth systematically
- Optimizing conversion at each stage
- Growth strategy planning

**When AARRR might not be needed:**
- Pre-MVP/pre-launch (no users to measure)
- Very early stage (focus on PMF first)
- Enterprise B2B with 2-3 customers (sample too small)
- One-off features or experiments

## How to Use This Framework

### Step 0: Braindump & Product Sense (Do this first!)

**Before mapping your funnel, braindump:**
- Where are users dropping off most in your funnel?
- Which stage feels weakest based on user feedback?
- Are you measuring vanity metrics or actionable growth metrics?
- What biases might affect your assessment? (Volume bias? Activity bias?)

**Product sense exercise:**
- If you could only fix ONE stage, which would have biggest impact?
- What would make you say "our funnel is obviously broken"?
- What would make you say "our funnel is working well"?

### Step 1: Map Your Funnel
Define what each stage means for your product (Acquisition, Activation, Retention, Revenue, Referral)

### Step 2: Identify Biggest Problem
Don't start with Acquisition just because it's first - identify your biggest bottleneck

### Step 3: Set Baseline Metrics
Measure current state for each stage and track conversion rates between stages

### Step 4: Focus and Optimize
Spend 80% effort on refining existing features, 20% on new ones

### Step 5: Monitor Interdependencies
Recognize that metrics influence each other - a flaw in one stage disrupts the entire process

### Step 6: Self-Reflection
After assessment, reflect:
- What did you learn? What surprised you?
- What biases did you catch? (Vanity metrics? Volume bias?)
- How did your product sense guide you?
- What would you do differently next time?

## How to Maintain

- **Weekly**: Quick Funnel Health Check
- **Monthly**: Update Full AARRR Dashboard
- **Quarterly**: Deep dive on weakest stage with Stage-Specific Analysis
- **As Needed**: Run A/B tests based on identified bottlenecks

## How This Fits in the System

**Discovery Frameworks (2.2-Discovery/):**
- Use `2.2.7-Product-Market-Fit/` to assess PMF before optimizing full funnel
- Use `2.2.5-Idea-Validation/` to test optimization hypotheses

**Strategy & Delivery (2.1-Strategy/):**
- Use `2.1.2-Strategic-Execution/1-OKR/` to set objectives targeting specific AARRR stages
- Use `2.1.2-Strategic-Execution/2-Roadmap/` to prioritize features that improve weakest stages
- Use `2.1.2-Strategic-Execution/3-North-Star/` to connect AARRR metrics to overall product health

**Other Methods (2.3-Execution/):**
- Use `2.3.6-Metrics/` to validate metric quality and avoid vanity metrics
