# User Stories Framework

## Introduction

This framework provides a structured method for writing user stories that capture user needs and define acceptance criteria. User stories translate customer needs into actionable development work.

## How to Use This Framework

### Step 0: Braindump & Product Sense (Do this first!)

**Before writing stories, braindump:**
- What problem are we solving? For whom?
- What does your product sense tell you about this feature?
- Are we solving the right problem or just adding features?

**Product sense exercise:**
- If this story takes 2 weeks to build, will it create 2 weeks' worth of value?
- What would make you say "this story is obviously wrong"?

### Step 1: Review Framework
Read `1-user-stories.md` to understand the user story format and best practices

### Step 2: Write Your Story
Use the "As a/I want/So that" format with specific user types and clear benefits

### Step 3: Add Acceptance Criteria
Define 3-5 testable acceptance criteria that clearly define "done"

### Step 4: Validate with INVEST
Ensure your story meets INVEST criteria (Independent, Negotiable, Valuable, Estimable, Small, Testable)

### Step 5: Split if Needed
If the story is too large (>5 days), use splitting patterns to break it down

### Step 6: Self-Reflection
After writing stories, reflect:
- Do these stories capture real user value?
- Are they clear enough for the team to estimate?
- What would you do differently?

## When to Use

- Breaking down features into development tasks
- Communicating requirements to engineering
- Planning sprints and estimating work
- Creating shared understanding of what to build

## How to Maintain

- **During Sprint Planning**: Review and refine stories before committing
- **After Sprint**: Reflect on story quality and clarity
- **Quarterly**: Review story patterns and improve templates
