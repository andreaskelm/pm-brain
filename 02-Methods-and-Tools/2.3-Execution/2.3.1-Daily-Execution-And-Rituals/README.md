# Daily Execution & Rituals Framework

## Introduction

This framework provides step-by-step instructions for day-to-day PM execution in large organizations. These are the "Tuesday morning" guides—practical, actionable steps for what to do right now.

## Files

- `1-daily-rituals.md` — Daily routines (morning, midday, evening)
- `2-weekly-cadence.md` — Weekly rituals (Monday, Wednesday, Friday)
- `3-context-switching.md` — Context switching guide for managing multiple initiatives
- `4-common-scenarios.md` — Common daily scenarios and how to handle them

## How to Use This Framework

### Step 0: Braindump & Assess (Critical!)

**Before setting up your routines, braindump:**
- What does your typical day look like? Dump everything - don't judge yet.
- What does your product sense tell you? What's working? What's not?
- What assumptions are you making about how you should work?
- What biases might affect your routines? (Firefighting? Meeting overload?)

**Product sense exercise:**
- If you had to be 2x more effective, what would you change?
- What would make you say "this routine is obviously wrong"?
- What would make you say "this routine is obviously right"?

### Step 1: Start with Daily Rituals
Read `1-daily-rituals.md` and implement the daily routine first. This is your foundation.

### Step 2: Add Weekly Cadence
Once daily routines are working, add `2-weekly-cadence.md` for week-over-week structure.

### Step 3: Master Context Switching
If you're managing multiple initiatives, use `3-context-switching.md` to create context zones and minimize switching costs.

### Step 4: Handle Edge Cases
Reference `4-common-scenarios.md` when you encounter firefighting, ambiguity, or meeting overload.

### Step 5: Customize for Your Context
Adapt the routines to your specific role and organization.

### Step 6: Iterate and Improve
Adjust routines based on what works and what doesn't.

### Step 7: Self-Reflection
Regularly reflect on your execution effectiveness:
- What's working well?
- What needs improvement?
- How can you be more effective?
