# Daily Execution & Rituals Framework

## Introduction

This framework provides step-by-step instructions for day-to-day PM execution in large organizations. These are the "Tuesday morning" guides—practical, actionable steps for what to do right now.

## Files

- `1-daily-rituals.md` — Daily routines (morning, midday, evening)
- `2-weekly-cadence.md` — Weekly rituals (Monday, Wednesday, Friday)
- `3-context-switching.md` — Context switching guide for managing multiple initiatives
- `4-common-scenarios.md` — Common daily scenarios and how to handle them

## How to Use This Framework

### Step 0: Braindump & Assess (Critical!)

**Use prompts from:** [2-product-sense-prompts.md](../../../../../2.0-Foundations/2.0.1-Mental-Models/6-Product-Sense-Development/2-product-sense-prompts.md) → [Generic Step 0 (any framework)](../../../../../2.0-Foundations/2.0.1-Mental-Models/6-Product-Sense-Development/2-product-sense-prompts.md#generic-step-0-any-framework).

**Quick start:** What does your typical day look like? What's working? What's not? What assumptions about how you should work? What biases might affect your routines? **See prompts file for full list.**

**Product sense exercise:**
- If you had to be 2x more effective, what would you change?
- What would make you say "this routine is obviously wrong"?
- What would make you say "this routine is obviously right"?

### Step 1: Start with Daily Rituals
Read `1-daily-rituals.md` and implement the daily routine first. This is your foundation.

### Step 2: Add Weekly Cadence
Once daily routines are working, add `2-weekly-cadence.md` for week-over-week structure.

### Step 3: Master Context Switching
If you're managing multiple initiatives, use `3-context-switching.md` to create context zones and minimize switching costs.

### Step 4: Handle Edge Cases
Reference `4-common-scenarios.md` when you encounter firefighting, ambiguity, or meeting overload.

### Step 5: Customize for Your Context
Adapt the routines to your specific role and organization.

### Step 6: Iterate and Improve
Adjust routines based on what works and what doesn't.

### Step 7: Self-Reflection
Regularly reflect on your execution effectiveness:
- What's working well?
- What needs improvement?
- How can you be more effective?
