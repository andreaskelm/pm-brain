# Daily PM Rituals

## Overview

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for day-to-day PM execution in large organizations. These are the "Tuesday morning" guides—practical, actionable steps for what to do right now.

## Step 0: Braindump & Assess (Critical!)

**Use prompts from:** [2-product-sense-prompts.md](../../../../../2.0-Foundations/2.0.1-Mental-Models/6-Product-Sense-Development/2-product-sense-prompts.md) → [Generic Step 0 (any framework)](../../../../../2.0-Foundations/2.0.1-Mental-Models/6-Product-Sense-Development/2-product-sense-prompts.md#generic-step-0-any-framework). Quick start: What does your typical day look like? What's working? What's not? What assumptions? What biases? **See prompts file for full list.**

**Product sense exercise:**
- If you had to be 2x more effective, what would you change?
- What would make you say "this routine is obviously wrong"?
- What would make you say "this routine is obviously right"?

## Daily PM Rituals

### Your Daily Operating System

**Purpose:** Create predictable structure that prevents firefighting and ensures nothing falls through cracks.

**Time Required:** 60-90 minutes of structured time across the day

-----

### MORNING ROUTINE (30-45 minutes)

**Best Time:** First thing after coffee, before meetings

**STEP 1: Check Critical Signals (10 min)**

**In this order:**

```
☐ Production/System Health
- Check status page / monitoring dashboard
- Any incidents overnight?
- Customer-reported issues in Slack/email?

☐ Team Blockers
- Skim team Slack channel
- Any blockers raised in async updates?
- Anyone need urgent help?

☐ Stakeholder Requests
- New email from leadership
- Slack DMs from key stakeholders
- Any "urgent" flags

☐ Key Metrics
- Check your core metrics dashboard
- Any unusual changes or alerts?
- Compare to yesterday/last week
```

**Decision Point:** Is anything on fire that needs immediate attention?

- **YES →** Handle the fire (see Common Scenarios section)
- **NO →** Continue with routine

-----

**STEP 2: Review Today's Commitments (10 min)**

**Open your calendar and task list:**

```
☐ What meetings do I have?
- Can any be cancelled/shortened?
- What prep is needed?
- What decisions need to be made?

☐ What must get done today?
- Commitments to others
- Deadlines
- Follow-ups I promised

☐ What can wait if needed?
- Important but not urgent
- Can be delegated
- Can move to tomorrow
```

**Create today's focus list (3-5 items max):**

```markdown
## Today: [Date]

### MUST DO (Committed)
1. [Task with time estimate and why it matters]
2. [Task with time estimate and why it matters]

### SHOULD DO (High Value)
3. [Task with time estimate]
4. [Task with time estimate]

### COULD DO (If Time)
5. [Task with time estimate]

### DELEGATE/DEFER
- [What I'm moving or giving to others]
```

-----

**STEP 3: Protect Your Focus Time (5 min)**

**Block calendar for deep work:**

- [ ] 2-hour block for focused work (protect this)
- [ ] 30-min buffer before big meetings
- [ ] 15-min breaks between back-to-back meetings

**Set boundaries:**

```
- Slack status: "🎯 Focus time until [X]"
- Close email
- Turn off notifications
- Let team know you're heads-down
```

-----

**STEP 4: Quick Team Check-In (10 min)**

**If you have a team:**

```
☐ Scan team updates (async standups, Slack)
☐ Anyone blocked? Can I unblock them now?
☐ Any celebrations or wins to acknowledge?
☐ Anyone need air cover or support?
```

**Quick Slack message to team:**

```
Morning team! 👋

Blockers I'm handling today:
- [Blocker you're working to remove]
- [Decision you're making]

Available for:
- Quick questions: Slack me
- Longer discussions: Grab time after 2pm
- Urgent stuff: Interrupt me

Focus time: 9-11am (async only unless urgent)

Let's ship it! 🚀
```

-----

**MORNING ROUTINE COMPLETE ✅**
You now know: What's on fire, what's due today, where you'll focus

-----

### MIDDAY CHECK-IN (10-15 minutes)

**Best Time:** Lunch or mid-afternoon (12pm-2pm)

**STEP 1: Progress Check**

```
☐ Morning focus work: Did I complete it?
- YES → Great, what's next priority?
- NO → What's blocking me? Can I unblock it?

☐ Meetings so far: Any follow-ups needed?
- Action items to capture
- Decisions to document
- People to follow up with

☐ New issues: Anything pop up that changes priorities?
- Urgent requests
- Customer escalations
- Team blockers
```

-----

**STEP 2: Adjust Afternoon Plan**

```
Afternoon meetings: [List them]

Available time between meetings: [Calculate it]

Realistic afternoon goals:
1. [Most important thing]
2. [Second priority if time]

Moving to tomorrow:
- [What's not getting done today]
```

-----

**STEP 3: Quick Communication Sweep**

```
☐ Slack: Respond to anything waiting on me
☐ Email: Handle anything urgent (not full inbox zero)
☐ Calendar: Prep for afternoon meetings
☐ Team: Check if anyone needs help
```

-----

### EVENING WRAP-UP (15-20 minutes)

**Best Time:** Last 20 minutes of work day

**STEP 1: Close the Loop (10 min)**

```
☐ Action items from today's meetings
- Captured in task system
- Scheduled or assigned

☐ Promises made
- Logged and tracked
- Follow-ups scheduled

☐ Documents/notes
- Meeting notes shared
- Decisions documented
- Key points sent to stakeholders
```

-----

**STEP 2: Prepare Tomorrow (5 min)**

```
☐ Review tomorrow's calendar
- Any prep needed tonight?
- Any conflicts to resolve?
- Any meetings to move?

☐ Create tomorrow's tentative focus list
- 3 most important things
- Based on what didn't get done today

☐ Set yourself up for success
- Documents you'll need
- Questions to think about overnight
- People to talk to
```

-----

**STEP 3: Inbox/Slack Zero Attempt (5 min)**

```
☐ Email: Get to inbox zero (or close)
- Respond to urgent
- Defer others with note
- Archive processed items

☐ Slack: Clear DMs and mentions
- Respond or acknowledge
- Snooze to tomorrow if not urgent
- Clear notification count

☐ Task list: Updated and prioritized

```

-----

**STEP 4: Mental Reset (2 min)**

```
✅ Wins today:
- [Something you shipped or moved forward]
- [Someone you helped]
- [Problem you solved]

📝 Learn tomorrow:
- [What could have gone better]
- [What to do differently]

🧘 Let it go:

- Don't check Slack/email until tomorrow
- Trust your system
```
