## 🎯 Common Daily Scenarios

### Scenario: Everything Feels Urgent

**When your day is all firefighting:**

**STEP 1: Triage (10 minutes)**

```
List everything that feels urgent:
1. [Item]
2. [Item]
3. [Item]

For each, ask:
- Urgent AND Important? → Do now
- Urgent, NOT Important? → Delegate or defer
- Important, NOT Urgent? → Schedule properly
- Neither? → Delete/ignore

Reality check:
- Does this need MY attention?
- Could someone else handle it?
- What happens if I don't do this today?
```

**STEP 2: Create forcing function**

```
Pick ONE thing that MUST happen today:
[THE ONE THING]

Everything else is secondary.

Why this one thing?
- [Impact if done]
- [Cost if not done]

Time block: [X-Y] - No meetings, no interruptions
```

### Scenario: Stuck and Don't Know What to Do Next

**When you're paralyzed by ambiguity:**

**STEP 1: Externalize (5 minutes)**

Write out:

```
What I'm trying to accomplish:
[Goal]

Why I'm stuck:
[The blocker or uncertainty]

What I don't know:
[Specific unknowns]

What I do know:
[What's clear]
```

**STEP 2: Find one action (5 minutes)**

```
Even if I don't know the answer, I could:
- [ ] Talk to [person] who might know
- [ ] Research [specific thing]
- [ ] Try [small experiment]
- [ ] Document [what I know so far]
- [ ] Ask [stakeholder] for guidance

The smallest possible next step:
[ONE concrete action, 30 min or less]
```

**STEP 3: Take the step**

Do the smallest next action. Progress creates momentum.

### Scenario: Meeting-Filled Day, No Focus Time

**When calendar is 100% booked:**

**Options:**

**A) Block morning before meetings start**

```
- Come in 1 hour early OR
- Block 8-10am for focus (move first meeting)
```

**B) Use between-meeting gaps**

```
30-min gap between meetings:
- 5 min: Context switch
- 20 min: Focused micro-task
- 5 min: Prep for next meeting
```

**C) Protect next day**

```
Today is lost to meetings.
Block 50% of tomorrow for focus work.
Accept today as a meeting day.
```

**D) Cancel/shorten meetings**

```
"I need to reschedule our 1:1 to protect focus time.
Does [other time] work?"

or

"Can we do 30 min instead of 60? I can cover [key points]."
```
