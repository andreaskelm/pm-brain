# Weekly PM Cadence

## Overview

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for week-over-week PM execution. These rituals ensure nothing falls through cracks and help you maintain momentum across multiple initiatives.

## Step 0: Braindump & Assess (Critical!)

**Before setting up your weekly routines, braindump:**
- What does your typical week look like? Dump everything - don't judge yet.
- What does your product sense tell you? What's working? What's not?
- What assumptions are you making about how you should work week-over-week?
- What biases might affect your weekly routines? (Planning too much? Not planning enough?)

**Product sense exercise:**
- If you had to be 2x more effective week-over-week, what would you change?
- What would make you say "this weekly routine is obviously wrong"?
- What would make you say "this weekly routine is obviously right"?
