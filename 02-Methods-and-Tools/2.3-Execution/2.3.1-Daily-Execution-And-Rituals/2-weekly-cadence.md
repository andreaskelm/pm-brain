# Weekly PM Cadence

## Overview

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for week-over-week PM execution. These rituals ensure nothing falls through cracks and help you maintain momentum across multiple initiatives.

## Step 0: Braindump & Assess (Critical!)

**Use prompts from:** [2-product-sense-prompts.md](../../../../../2.0-Foundations/2.0.1-Mental-Models/6-Product-Sense-Development/2-product-sense-prompts.md) → [Generic Step 0 (any framework)](../../../../../2.0-Foundations/2.0.1-Mental-Models/6-Product-Sense-Development/2-product-sense-prompts.md#generic-step-0-any-framework). Quick start: What does your typical week look like? What's working? What's not? What assumptions about week-over-week? What biases? **See prompts file for full list.**

**Product sense exercise:**
- If you had to be 2x more effective week-over-week, what would you change?
- What would make you say "this weekly routine is obviously wrong"?
- What would make you say "this weekly routine is obviously right"?
