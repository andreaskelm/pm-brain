# Context Switching Guide

## Overview

This guide helps PMs manage multiple initiatives, stakeholders, and priorities by creating clear context zones and minimizing the cognitive cost of switching between different areas of work.

## Step 0: Braindump & Assess (Critical!)

**Use prompts from:** [2-product-sense-prompts.md](../../../../../2.0-Foundations/2.0.1-Mental-Models/6-Product-Sense-Development/2-product-sense-prompts.md) → [Generic Step 0 (any framework)](../../../../../2.0-Foundations/2.0.1-Mental-Models/6-Product-Sense-Development/2-product-sense-prompts.md#generic-step-0-any-framework). Quick start: What "worlds" do you work in? Where do you spend too much/too little time? What assumptions about allocating time? What biases? **See prompts file for full list.**

**Product sense exercise:**
- If you had to be 2x more effective across all your initiatives, what would you change?
- What would make you say "this context switching approach is obviously wrong"?
- What would make you say "this context switching approach is obviously right"?

## Context Switching Guide

### Managing Multiple Initiatives

**Reality:** PMs rarely work on just one thing. You're juggling multiple initiatives, stakeholders, and priorities.

-----

### STEP 1: Map Your Context Zones

**Identify your distinct areas of work:**

```markdown
## My Context Zones

### ZONE 1: [Project/Initiative Name]
- **Time allocation:** [X%]
- **Status:** [Phase of work]
- **Key people:** [Stakeholders]
- **Next milestone:** [Date and deliverable]

### ZONE 2: [Project/Initiative Name]
- [Same structure]

### ZONE 3: [BAU/Operations]
- **Time allocation:** [X%]
- **Includes:** Metrics reviews, team management, customer feedback

### ZONE 4: [Strategic/Future]
- **Time allocation:** [X%]
- **Includes:** Discovery, planning, stakeholder relationships
```

**Ideal split:** 70% execution, 20% operations, 10% future/strategy

-----

### STEP 2: Time Block by Context

**Don't mix contexts in same time block**

**Example Weekly Schedule:**

```
MONDAY
- 9-11am: ZONE 1 (Project A deep work)
- 11-12pm: ZONE 3 (Metrics review, team 1-on-1s)
- 1-3pm: ZONE 2 (Project B meetings)
- 3-4pm: ZONE 3 (Inbox/Slack, admin)

TUESDAY
- 9-11am: ZONE 2 (Project B deep work)
- 11-12pm: ZONE 4 (Discovery interviews)
- 1-2pm: ZONE 1 (Project A stakeholder sync)
- 2-4pm: ZONE 1 (Project A work)

[Continue for week]
```

**Benefits:**

- Reduces context switching cost
- Allows deeper focus
- Makes saying no easier ("That's not my focus today")

-----

### STEP 3: Create Context Switching Rituals

**Between contexts, take 5-10 minutes:**

**CLOSE previous context:**

```
☐ Capture open loops (write down where you left off)
☐ Document next steps
☐ Close related tabs/documents
☐ Clear mental state
```

**OPEN next context:**

```
☐ Review where you left off
☐ Check priority for this context
☐ Open relevant documents
☐ Set intention (what you want to accomplish)
```

**Example ritual:**

```
Closing Project A:
- Save current work
- Write "Next: Review design mocks" in task
- Close Figma, Slack channels
- Take 2-minute break

Opening Project B:
- Read yesterday's notes
- Check "Today's focus" for Project B
- Open PRD and Jira
- Set timer for 90-min focus block
```

-----

### STEP 4: Triage Interruptions

**When something urgent comes up:**

**Interrupt Decision Tree:**

```
Is this actually urgent?
└─ NO → Add to appropriate context zone, handle later
└─ YES → Ask: Can it wait until my next context switch?
└─ YES → Schedule for next appropriate time block
└─ NO → Handle now, but:
1. Close current context properly
2. Handle interruption
3. Decide: Return to previous context or move on?
```

**Response templates:**

**"Not urgent":**

> "Adding this to my [Project X] time tomorrow. Will update you by EOD tomorrow."

**"Can wait 2 hours":**

> "I'm in focused work until 2pm. Can we discuss at 2:15? If it can't wait, let me know and I'll switch contexts."

**"Truly urgent":**

> "On it. Give me 5 min to wrap what I'm doing, then I'm fully on this."

-----

### STEP 5: Protect Your Focus Time

**Daily focus time (non-negotiable):**

```
☐ 2-3 hours blocked daily
☐ Clearly marked on calendar
☐ Slack status: "🎯 Focus time"
☐ Phone on Do Not Disturb
☐ Email closed
☐ Slack muted (except DMs from manager)
```

**When someone tries to book over it:**

> "I have focus time blocked then. I have [other time] available. If it's truly urgent, I can move focus time to [alternate time]."

-----

### STEP 6: Weekly Context Review

**Friday afternoon (15 min):**

```markdown
## Context Review - Week of [Date]

### TIME ALLOCATION (Actual)
- Zone 1 (Project A): [X%] (Target: [Y%])
- Zone 2 (Project B): [X%] (Target: [Y%])
- Zone 3 (Operations): [X%] (Target: [Y%])
- Zone 4 (Strategy): [X%] (Target: [Y%])
- Interruptions: [X%]

### ASSESSMENT
✅ What worked well this week?
❌ What didn't work?
🔄 What to adjust next week?

### NEXT WEEK ALLOCATION
Based on priorities, adjust time blocks:
- [Context]: [X%] because [reason]
```
