## Methods & Tools – The PM Operating System

This directory is the **core of the PM brain**: it contains the decision models, guides, templates, playbooks, and prompts you use every day to **ship valuable products**.

**Important:** These frameworks are designed to **guide your thinking**, not replace it. Before jumping into templates:
1. **Braindump first** – Use the prompts in each framework to dump your raw thoughts
2. **Develop product sense** – Use the exercises to build judgment and taste
3. **Think critically** – Answer quiz questions honestly, challenge your assumptions
4. **Reflect** – Use self-reflection prompts to learn and improve

**To start a product-thinking chat (e.g. with AI):** Use the single entry point [0-start-here-product-thinking.md](2.0-Foundations/2.0.1-Mental-Models/6-Product-Sense-Development/0-start-here-product-thinking.md) — copy the simple prompt at the top; the agent will braindump with you before suggesting any framework. After braindump, use the **Frameworks by situation** table there (or the domain READMEs below) to jump to Strategy, Discovery, Execution, or Communication.

Content is organized by **the flow of product work**: from foundational thinking → defining direction → discovering what to build → executing and shipping → aligning stakeholders. This logical progression helps you move from ambiguity to shipped outcomes.

## How PM Work Flows (2.0 → 2.1 → 2.2 → 2.3 → 2.4)

### 2.0-Foundations/ — HOW TO THINK

**Mental models, bias awareness, self-reflection**

Start here to build foundational product sense. Learn how to think about product decisions, recognize biases, and develop judgment that guides all other work.

- `2.0.1-Mental-Models/` - Decision-making models, product thinking, work levels, execution hygiene, team dynamics
- `2.0.2-Bias/` - Recognize and mitigate cognitive biases
- `2.0.3-Self-Reflection/` - Regular reflection to improve your product sense

---

### 2.1-Strategy/ — WHERE ARE WE GOING?

**Strategic foundations (vision, strategy choices) + Strategic execution (OKRs, roadmap, north star, prioritization)**

Define direction before discovering solutions. Set vision, make strategic choices, translate into goals and plans.

- `2.1.1-Strategic-Foundations/` - Strategy Blocks, Good Strategy/Bad Strategy, Playing to Win
- `2.1.2-Strategic-Execution/` - OKRs, Roadmap, North Star, Prioritization (RICE/ICE, MoSCoW, Kano)

---

### 2.2-Discovery/ — WHAT TO BUILD?

**Research interviews, continuous discovery, JTBD, opportunity assessment, validation, PMF**

Learn from customers, validate assumptions, find the right problem to solve. Continuous learning reduces risk.

- `2.2.1-Research-Interviews/` - How to conduct effective user research
- `2.2.2-Continuous-Discovery-Habits/` - Snapshot, synthesize, opportunities, solutions
- `2.2.3-Jobs-To-Be-Done/` - Understand the job customers hire your product to do

- `2.2.6-Problem-Solution-Space/` - Navigate discovery using Double Diamond, Opportunity Solution Trees
- `2.2.7-Product-Market-Fit/` - Assess whether you're solving a real problem well

---

### 2.3-Execution/ — BUILD, SHIP, MEASURE

**PRDs, personas, metrics, AARRR, daily rituals**

Specify, build, ship, and measure outcomes. Execution turns strategy and discovery into customer value.

- `2.3.1-Daily-Execution-And-Rituals/` - Daily/weekly operating rhythms
- `2.3.2-User-Stories/` - Translate requirements into implementable stories
- `2.3.3-Backlog-Prioritization/` - Prioritize execution work
- `2.3.4-PRD/` - Specify what to build and why
- `2.3.5-Personas/` - Define who you're building for
- `2.3.6-Metrics/` - Measure what matters
- `2.3.7-AARRR-Pirate-Metrics/` - Acquisition, Activation, Retention, Revenue, Referral

---

### 2.4-Communication/ — ALIGN STAKEHOLDERS

**Newsletters, meetings, one-pagers, crisis management, stakeholder management**

Keep everyone aligned throughout the journey. Communication happens continuously across all stages.

- `2.4.1-Newsletter/` - Regular stakeholder updates
- `2.4.2-Meeting-Agendas/` - Run effective meetings
- `2.4.3-One-Pagers/` - Communicate concisely
- `2.4.4-Crisis-Management/` - Handle urgent issues
- `2.4.5-Escalation/` - Escalate effectively

## Day-to-Day Operational Guide: Where Are You Right Now?

Use this guide to figure out which frameworks to use based on **where you are in the product journey**:

- **Starting a new area or initiative?** → `2.1-Strategy/` (foundations, OKRs)
- **Don't know what to build?** → `2.2-Discovery/` (interviews, JTBD, opportunities)
- **Ready to commit resources?** → `2.1-Strategy/` (prioritization, roadmap)
- **Ready to specify the work?** → `2.3-Execution/` (PRDs, personas)
- **Building and shipping?** → `2.3-Execution/` (daily rituals, metrics)
- **Uncertain if you have product-market fit?** → `2.2-Discovery/` (PMF assessment)
- **Need to align stakeholders?** → `2.4-Communication/` (anytime, continuously)
- **Stuck, biased, or need to reflect?** → `2.0-Foundations/` (mental models, bias, reflection)

---

## Flow-Based Navigation Examples

### Example: Launching a new initiative

Follow the full flow from thinking to shipping:

1. **2.0-Foundations** - Check biases, use mental models (pre-mortem, first principles)
2. **2.1-Strategy** - Define direction (strategy frameworks, OKRs)
3. **2.2-Discovery** - Talk to users (interviews, JTBD, identify opportunities)
4. **2.1-Strategy** - Prioritize and commit (prioritization frameworks, roadmap)
5. **2.3-Execution** - Specify the work (PRD, personas)
6. **2.3-Execution** - Build, ship, measure (daily rituals, metrics, AARRR)
7. **2.4-Communication** - Keep stakeholders aligned (newsletters, meetings, one-pagers)
8. **2.2-Discovery** - Validate you solved the right problem (PMF assessment)
9. **2.0-Foundations** - Reflect and learn (self-reflection)

**Where to save work:**
- Strategy artifacts → `04-Initiatives/[initiative-name]/`
- Research notes → `03-Research-Artifacts/`
- PRDs and specs → `04-Initiatives/[initiative-name]/`

### Example: Stuck in discovery

You're doing research but not making progress:

- Use `2.2-Discovery/` to structure research approach
- Check `2.0-Foundations/2.0.2-Bias/` - Are biases affecting your interpretation?
- Use `2.4-Communication/` to share findings and get feedback
- Review `2.1-Strategy/` - Is the strategic direction clear enough to guide discovery?

### Example: Team is building the wrong things

Something's misaligned - work back through the flow:

- **Check direction:** `2.1-Strategy/` - Is the direction clear? Do you have OKRs?
- **Check discovery:** `2.2-Discovery/` - Are you talking to users regularly? Do you understand JTBD?
- **Check measurement:** `2.3-Execution/2.3.6-Metrics/` - Are you measuring the right outcomes?
- **Check alignment:** `2.4-Communication/` - Do stakeholders understand the strategy?

### Example: Daily/weekly execution

You're in the rhythm of shipping:

- **Daily:** Use `2.3-Execution/2.3.1-Daily-Execution-And-Rituals/` for daily planning and focus
- **Weekly:** Review metrics (`2.3-Execution/2.3.6-Metrics/`), send updates (`2.4-Communication/2.4.1-Newsletter/`)
- **Continuously:** Talk to customers (`2.2-Discovery/2.2.1-Research-Interviews/`)
- **Regularly:** Reflect (`2.0-Foundations/2.0.3-Self-Reflection/`), check for biases

As you adapt these to your team, keep this flow-based structure but tune the content to match your reality.

## Quick start: self-quiz + AI collaboration for methods

Use this prompt to figure out **where to start in `02-Methods-and-Tools/`** when you're not sure which framework to use:

```markdown
Act as a product management coach. We'll work iteratively and challenge assumptions. Your role is to help me think, not to think for me.

1) First, help me braindump and locate the right area in the product flow:
- Ask me to braindump: "What are you trying to do right now? Dump all your thoughts, concerns, and ideas - don't worry about structure yet."
- Based on my braindump, ask clarifying questions to understand my context and challenge my assumptions.
- Propose 1–3 starting points under `02-Methods-and-Tools/` using the product flow structure:
  - 2.0-Foundations (HOW TO THINK: 2.0.1-Mental-Models, 2.0.2-Bias, 2.0.3-Self-Reflection)
  - 2.1-Strategy (WHERE ARE WE GOING: 2.1.1-Strategic-Foundations, 2.1.2-Strategic-Execution with OKR/Roadmap/North-Star/Prioritization)
  - 2.2-Discovery (WHAT TO BUILD: 2.2.1-Research-Interviews, 2.2.2-Continuous-Discovery-Habits, 2.2.3-Jobs-To-Be-Done, 2.2.4-Opportunity-Assessment, 2.2.5-Idea-Validation, 2.2.6-Problem-Solution-Space, 2.2.7-Product-Market-Fit)
  - 2.3-Execution (BUILD, SHIP, MEASURE: 2.3.1-Daily-Execution-And-Rituals, 2.3.2-User-Stories, 2.3.3-Backlog-Prioritization, 2.3.4-PRD, 2.3.5-Personas, 2.3.6-Metrics, 2.3.7-AARRR-Pirate-Metrics)
  - 2.4-Communication (ALIGN STAKEHOLDERS: 2.4.1-Newsletter, 2.4.2-Meeting-Agendas, 2.4.3-One-Pagers, 2.4.4-Crisis-Management, 2.4.5-Escalation, 2.4.6-Saying-No, 2.4.7-Stakeholder-Management, 2.4.9-Courses)

2) For the chosen starting framework:
- DON'T just ask me to paste notes. Instead, quiz me: "Before looking at your notes, tell me what you know about [topic]. What's your gut feeling? What assumptions are you making?"
- Help me braindump my thoughts on this topic first.
- Then ask me to paste any relevant notes or context.
- Challenge my thinking: "What biases might be affecting your view? What would someone with different product sense say?"
- Summarize which parts of the framework I've already covered vs what's missing.
- Suggest the next 1–3 concrete steps, but make me think: "What do you think should come next? Why?"

3) At the end of each pass:
- Ask me to reflect: "What did you learn? What would you do differently? What's your product sense telling you?"
- List: (a) the framework files I should touch next, (b) which repo directory to update in `04-Initiatives/` or `03-Research-Artifacts/`, and (c) any risks or open questions to track.
- Remind me of the product flow: Am I ready to move to the next stage (Foundations → Strategy → Discovery → Execution → Communication), or do I need to loop back?

I'll start by telling you what I'm working on right now.
```
