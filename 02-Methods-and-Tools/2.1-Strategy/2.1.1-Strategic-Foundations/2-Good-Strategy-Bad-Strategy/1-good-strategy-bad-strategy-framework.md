# Good Strategy/Bad Strategy - The Kernel

**Framework by:** Richard P. Rumelt (UCLA Anderson School of Management)  
**Published:** Book - *Good Strategy Bad Strategy: The Difference and Why It Matters* (2011)  
**What it is:** Strategy evaluation framework—the 3 essential elements that make a strategy "good"

## Overview

Good Strategy/Bad Strategy provides diagnostic criteria for evaluating whether your strategy is actually a strategy (and whether it's good). Rumelt defines the "kernel" as the barebone center of good strategy—three interdependent elements that MUST exist together.

**Core Definition:** "Strategy is a way through a difficulty, an approach to overcoming an obstacle, a response to a challenge."

## Step 0: Braindump & Product Sense (Do this first!)

**Before evaluating your strategy, braindump:**
- What's the real challenge we're facing? Don't polish—just dump everything you see.
- What does your product sense tell you is the REAL problem vs. symptoms?
- What assumptions might be hiding the true challenge?
- What biases might make us avoid facing hard truths? (Wishful thinking? Avoiding conflict?)

**Product sense exercise:**
- If you had to explain the challenge to a 10-year-old, what would you say?
- What would make you say "this strategy is obviously bad"?
- What would make you say "this strategy is obviously good"?

**When to use the Kernel:**
- Evaluating whether your strategy is actually a strategy
- Diagnosing why current strategy isn't working
- Teaching teams what good strategy looks like
- Reality-checking strategy documents (yours or others')

**When NOT to use:**
- Creating strategy from scratch (use Strategy Blocks or Playing to Win first)
- Tactical execution planning
- When you just need to pick features (use prioritization frameworks)

## Core Philosophy

### Good Strategy/Bad Strategy is NOT a Creation Framework

The Kernel is primarily a **diagnostic and evaluation tool**, not a step-by-step process for creating strategy. It helps you:

- **Evaluate existing strategies** - Does this strategy have all three elements?
- **Diagnose strategy problems** - What's missing or weak?
- **Validate strategy quality** - Is this actually good strategy?

**Common misconceptions:**
- ❌ "I'll use the Kernel to create my strategy from scratch" - Use Strategy Blocks or Playing to Win first, then validate with Kernel
- ❌ "The Kernel is my strategic plan" - Kernel is the core structure, not the full plan
- ❌ "If I have all three elements, my strategy is perfect" - Elements must be strong AND logically connected

### Core Principles

**Diagnosis first:**
- Strategy without clear diagnosis is just a plan
- Diagnosis explains WHY the challenge exists, not just WHAT the symptoms are
- Good diagnosis points toward a response

**Coherence matters:**
- Elements must logically connect: Diagnosis → Policy → Actions
- If elements don't connect, it's not good strategy
- Internal coherence creates power

**Simplicity over complexity:**
- Good strategy can be explained simply
- If you need jargon to explain it, rethink it
- The Kernel should fit on 1-2 pages

### The Kernel Philosophy

Good strategy is not about having ambitious goals or comprehensive plans. It's about having a clear understanding of the challenge, a coherent approach to addressing it, and coordinated actions that work together. The Kernel provides the minimal structure needed for good strategy—if any element is missing or weak, the strategy will fail.

---

## Framework Structure

The Kernel consists of three interdependent elements that form a logical chain:

### 1. Diagnosis

**What it is:** A clear and insightful definition of the challenge you face

**Structure:**
- Challenge statement (what's really going on)
- Root causes (why this challenge exists)
- Critical factors (what matters most)
- Insights from research/data

**Why it matters:** Without accurate diagnosis, you're solving the wrong problem. Like a doctor treating symptoms instead of the disease, strategy without diagnosis fails.

**Example:**
```
Challenge: "Small-town America is underserved by retailers"
Root cause: "Low population density makes conventional stores unprofitable"
Critical factors: Distribution costs, market size, competition
```

### 2. Guiding Policy

**What it is:** An overall approach for dealing with the obstacles identified in diagnosis

**Structure:**
- Overall approach (general direction)
- What we will do (the approach)
- What we will NOT do (explicit constraints)
- Why this approach (logic connecting to diagnosis)

**Why it matters:** Provides direction without over-specifying. Like guardrails on a highway, it guides action while allowing flexibility.

**Example:**
```
Approach: "Build large stores in small towns using logistics excellence"
Will do: Focus on operational efficiency and regional clustering
Won't do: Compete on price alone or expand to urban markets
Why: Addresses the distribution cost challenge identified in diagnosis
```

### 3. Coherent Actions

**What it is:** A set of coordinated and feasible actions designed to carry out the guiding policy

**Structure:**
- Specific actions (what, why, when, who)
- How actions reinforce each other
- Sequence and dependencies
- Resource requirements

**Why it matters:** Strategy without action is just a document. Actions must work together—coherent actions create power through coordination.

**Example:**
```
Action 1: Build distribution centers to serve store clusters
Action 2: Invest in logistics technology
Action 3: Negotiate supplier contracts leveraging total volume
How they cohere: Distribution centers enable low costs, low costs enable supplier leverage, leverage enables low prices
```

### How Elements Connect

The three elements form a logical chain:

```
DIAGNOSIS (what's going on)
    ↓ informs
GUIDING POLICY (how we'll approach it)
    ↓ informs
COHERENT ACTIONS (specific coordinated steps)
```

**Each element must exist AND connect logically to the others.**

## How to Use This Framework

The Kernel is both a **diagnostic tool** (evaluate existing strategies) and a **creation template** (build new strategies). 

Use it to ask: Does our strategy have all three elements? Are they logically connected?

## How to Maintain

- **Before publishing strategy:** Run kernel check
- **Quarterly:** Revisit if all 3 elements still hold
- **When strategy feels unclear:** Use kernel to diagnose gaps
- **When onboarding teams:** Teach kernel as "what good strategy is"

---

## The Kernel: Three Essential Elements

Good strategy has three parts that MUST work together:

```
1. DIAGNOSIS
   ↓ (informs)
2. GUIDING POLICY
   ↓ (informs)
3. COHERENT ACTIONS
```

**If any element is missing or weak, it's not good strategy.**

---

## Element 1: Diagnosis

### What It Means
A clear and insightful definition of the challenge you face. Diagnosis simplifies a complex situation and identifies what's truly critical.

**The core question:** "What's going on here?"

### Why It Matters
- A doctor treats based on diagnosis—if diagnosis is wrong, treatment fails
- Diagnosis informs your response to the challenge
- Without diagnosis, you're solving the wrong problem

### How to Diagnose
1. **Gather facts about the situation:**
   - What's happening in the market?
   - What are customer behaviors?
   - What are competitors doing?
   - What are our constraints?

2. **Look for the REAL challenge, not symptoms:**
   - Declining revenue (symptom) vs. "Competitors have better value prop" (challenge)
   - Low engagement (symptom) vs. "Product doesn't solve core job" (challenge)

3. **Frame the challenge with insight:**
   - Not just describing, but EXPLAINING
   - Identifying critical factors
   - Naming what matters most

4. **Test for clarity:**
   - Can you explain it simply?
   - Does it point to a response?
   - Would someone unfamiliar understand the challenge?

### Example Diagnoses

**Bad (too vague):**
- "Market is competitive"
- "We need to grow faster"
- "Users aren't engaged"

**Good (clear and insightful):**
- **George Kennan (US-Soviet relations, 1940s):** "The challenge is a long-term struggle without possibility of negotiated settlement, requiring patient containment."
- **Walmart (1970s):** "Small-town America is underserved by retailers due to low population density making conventional stores unprofitable."
- **Stephanie's grocery store:** "Challenge is competition with supermarket that has lower prices and is open 24/7."

**Key difference:** Good diagnosis explains WHY the challenge exists and points toward a response.

### Common Mistakes
- ❌ Describing symptoms, not root causes
- ❌ Stating goals as diagnosis: "We need to grow 50%"
- ❌ Avoiding uncomfortable truths
- ❌ Using jargon to hide unclear thinking

### Test Your Diagnosis
- Does it explain what's really going on?
- Does it identify the critical factors?
- Does it point toward a possible response?
- Would it still be true if you removed all jargon?

---

## Element 2: Guiding Policy

### What It Means
An overall approach for dealing with the obstacles identified in the diagnosis. Like guardrails on a highway—it directs action without fully defining every step.

**The core question:** "How will we deal with this challenge?"

### Why It Matters
- Provides direction without over-specifying
- Creates constraints that focus effort
- Enables coordinated action
- Distinguishes how you'll respond from how others might

### How to Create
1. **Start from diagnosis:**
   - What approach would address the identified challenge?

2. **Define the overall approach:**
   - Not specific actions yet
   - The general direction and principles

3. **Create constraints:**
   - What will we do?
   - What will we NOT do?
   - What principles guide our actions?

4. **Test for coherence:**
   - Does this actually address the diagnosis?
   - Is it specific enough to guide action?
   - Is it general enough to allow flexibility?

### Example Guiding Policies

**Diagnosis → Guiding Policy:**

**Walmart:**
- Diagnosis: Small-town America underserved due to low density
- Guiding Policy: Build large stores in small towns, use logistics excellence to keep costs low despite small market size

**Stephanie's grocery:**
- Diagnosis: Can't compete with supermarket on price or hours
- Guiding Policy: Focus on time-sensitive professionals who value convenience over price

**Desert Storm:**
- Diagnosis: Enemy concentrated in Kuwait, supply lines exposed
- Guiding Policy: Avoid direct confrontation with strongest units, cut supply lines, force withdrawal

**Apple (Steve Jobs return, 1997):**
- Diagnosis: Too many products diluting focus, company near bankruptcy
- Guiding Policy: Ruthlessly pare down to 4 products (consumer/pro × desktop/portable), focus all resources

### Common Mistakes
- ❌ Too generic: "Deliver great products and service"
- ❌ Just listing goals: "Grow revenue, increase engagement"
- ❌ Too specific: Jumping straight to detailed actions
- ❌ Doesn't address diagnosis: Policy that ignores the identified challenge

### Test Your Guiding Policy
- Does it flow logically from the diagnosis?
- Does it create direction and constraints?
- Would someone else understand what to do (and NOT do)?
- Is it different from obvious/generic approaches?

---

## Element 3: Coherent Actions

### What It Means
A set of coordinated and feasible actions designed to carry out the guiding policy. Not just any actions—actions that work together toward the same end.

**The core question:** "What specific steps will we take?"

### Why It Matters
- Strategy without action is just a document
- Actions without coherence are aimless
- Coherent actions create power through coordination

### How to Define
1. **Work backward from guiding policy:**
   - What actions would implement this approach?

2. **Ensure coordination:**
   - Do actions reinforce each other?
   - Are there dependencies?
   - Do they work toward same goal?

3. **Make them feasible:**
   - Can we actually do these?
   - Do we have resources?
   - What's the sequence?

4. **Test for coherence:**
   - Do all actions support the guiding policy?
   - Are they mutually reinforcing?
   - Is anything working against the others?

### Example Coherent Actions

**Walmart (small-town strategy):**
- Build distribution centers to serve cluster of small-town stores efficiently
- Invest in logistics technology to minimize inventory costs
- Negotiate supplier contracts leveraging total volume across all stores
- Hire local staff who understand small-town customers
- Keep prices low through operational efficiency

**How they cohere:** Each action reinforces others—distribution centers enable low inventory, volume enables supplier deals, local staff + low prices win small towns.

**Stephanie's grocery (focus on time-sensitive professionals):**
- Stock prepared meals and quick dinner solutions
- Offer delivery service to nearby offices
- Stay open during commute hours (7am-8pm)
- Create grab-and-go section at entrance
- Partner with local caterers for office lunches

**How they cohere:** All actions serve time-sensitive professionals who value convenience.

### Common Mistakes
- ❌ Laundry list: Actions that don't connect
- ❌ Missing feasibility: Can't actually execute
- ❌ Not from guiding policy: Random actions
- ❌ Incoherent: Actions that contradict each other

### Test Your Coherent Actions
- Do they flow from the guiding policy?
- Do they reinforce each other?
- Are they feasible with available resources?
- Together, do they overcome the challenge?

---

## How the Kernel Works Together

The three elements form a **logical chain**:

```
DIAGNOSIS: "Here's what's really going on"
     ↓
GUIDING POLICY: "Here's how we'll approach it"
     ↓
COHERENT ACTIONS: "Here are the specific coordinated steps"
```

**Each element must exist and must connect to the others.**

## The Four Hallmarks of Bad Strategy

Rumelt identifies patterns that reveal bad strategy:

### 1. Fluff
**What it is:** Jargon, buzzwords, and abstractions that mask absence of thought

**Examples:**
- "Leverage synergies to maximize stakeholder value"
- "Be customer-centric and data-driven"
- "Pursue excellence through innovation"

**Why it's bad:** Says nothing specific, prevents clear thinking

**How to detect:** If removing all adjectives makes it meaningless, it's fluff

### 2. Failure to Face the Challenge
**What it is:** Not defining or confronting the actual problem

**Examples:**
- Describing symptoms without diagnosis
- Ignoring competitive threats
- Pretending constraints don't exist

**Why it's bad:** Can't solve a problem you won't name

**How to detect:** No clear statement of what challenge is being addressed

### 3. Mistaking Goals for Strategy
**What it is:** Stating ambitious goals without explaining HOW to achieve them

**Examples:**
- "Grow revenue 50%"
- "Become market leader"
- "Achieve 100M users"

**Why it's bad:** Goals aren't strategy—strategy is the approach to reaching goals

**How to detect:** Can replace "strategy" with "goal" without changing meaning

### 4. Bad Strategic Objectives
**What it is:** Long lists of things to do, often conflicting or unrealistic

**Examples:**
- "Improve quality AND reduce costs AND increase speed AND expand markets"
- 47-point "strategic plan"
- Objectives that can't all be achieved with available resources

**Why it's bad:** Dilutes focus, creates contradictions, guarantees mediocrity

**How to detect:** Too many objectives, no clear priorities, obvious resource conflicts

## Real-World Example: Walmart's Small-Town Strategy

### Context
1970s: Retail dominated by urban department stores and regional chains. Small-town America largely ignored.

### The Kernel

**DIAGNOSIS:**
Small-town America (populations 5,000-25,000) is underserved by major retailers because:
- Low population density makes conventional retail unprofitable
- Can't achieve economies of scale in single small market
- Distribution costs too high for scattered locations

**GUIDING POLICY:**
Build large discount stores in small towns, using logistics excellence and regional clustering to achieve profitability despite low market density.

**COHERENT ACTIONS:**
1. Build stores in small towns competitors ignore
2. Cluster stores regionally to share distribution infrastructure
3. Build distribution centers to serve store clusters efficiently
4. Invest heavily in logistics technology and inventory management
5. Negotiate with suppliers using combined volume of all stores
6. Keep prices low through operational efficiency, not by being cheapest supplier
7. Hire local staff who understand small-town customers
8. Reinvest profits into more small-town stores (expand cluster)

**How it coheres:**
- Regional clustering makes distribution centers economical
- Distribution centers enable low inventory costs
- Low costs enable low prices even with small market size
- Low prices + local understanding win small towns
- Success in one cluster funds next cluster
- Combined volume across clusters enables supplier leverage

**Result:**
Walmart became world's largest retailer by systematically winning in markets competitors ignored.

**Key lesson:**
All three kernel elements present and logically connected. Not just "low prices" (goal) but clear diagnosis of why small towns were underserved and coherent approach to profitably serving them.

## Decision Tree: When to Use the Kernel

```
START: Do you have a strategy?
│
├─ Need to CREATE strategy?
│  └─ Use Strategy Blocks or Playing to Win
│     (then validate with Kernel)
│
├─ Need to EVALUATE strategy?
│  └─ Use Kernel (this framework)
│
├─ Strategy feels unclear?
│  ├─ Missing diagnosis? → Work on Element 1
│  ├─ Missing approach? → Work on Element 2
│  └─ Missing actions? → Work on Element 3
│
└─ Strategy not working?
   └─ Run Kernel check:
      - Is diagnosis correct?
      - Is policy appropriate?
      - Are actions coherent?
```

---

## Integration with Other Frameworks

### Combining Kernel with Strategy Blocks

**When to combine:** When evaluating Strategy Blocks output or validating strategic pillars

**How they work together:**
- Strategy Blocks provides process for creating strategy
- Kernel provides evaluation criteria for Strategy Blocks output
- Strategic pillars should function as guiding policy
- Illustrative concepts should be coherent actions

**Example workflow:**
```
Step 1: Use Strategy Blocks to create 2-year strategy with strategic pillars
Step 2: Evaluate with Kernel:
  - Diagnosis: Does strategy clearly define the challenge?
  - Guiding Policy: Do strategic pillars provide overall approach?
  - Coherent Actions: Are illustrative concepts coordinated?
Step 3: Strengthen any weak kernel elements
```

### Combining Kernel with Playing to Win

**When to combine:** When validating Playing to Win strategic choices

**How they work together:**
- Playing to Win provides strategic choice framework (5 questions)
- Kernel provides structure for those choices
- Playing to Win answers map to Kernel elements
- Kernel validates coherence of Playing to Win choices

**Example workflow:**
```
Step 1: Answer Playing to Win 5 questions
Step 2: Map answers to Kernel:
  - Diagnosis: Emerges from "where to play" and "how to win" analysis
  - Guiding Policy: The "how to win" choice
  - Coherent Actions: Flow from "capabilities" and "systems"
Step 3: Validate Kernel coherence
```

### Combining Kernel with OKRs

**When to combine:** When operationalizing strategy into measurable outcomes

**How they work together:**
- Kernel provides strategic structure
- OKRs operationalize strategy into measurable outcomes
- Objectives should flow from guiding policy
- Key Results should measure progress on coherent actions

**Example workflow:**
```
Step 1: Define strategy using Kernel (Diagnosis, Policy, Actions)
Step 2: Create OKRs that operationalize strategy:
  - Objectives align to guiding policy
  - Key Results measure coherent actions
Step 3: Track OKR progress to validate strategy execution
```

### Combining Kernel with Roadmaps

**When to combine:** When building roadmaps that execute strategy

**How they work together:**
- Kernel defines what strategy is
- Roadmaps define how to execute strategy
- Roadmap initiatives should implement coherent actions
- Roadmap priorities informed by guiding policy

**Example workflow:**
```
Step 1: Define strategy using Kernel
Step 2: Identify initiatives that implement coherent actions
Step 3: Prioritize initiatives using guiding policy
Step 4: Build roadmap with prioritized initiatives
```

### Typical Integration Patterns

**Pattern 1: Strategy Creation → Validation**
- Strategy Blocks or Playing to Win → Kernel Evaluation → OKRs → Roadmap
- **Use when:** Creating new strategy and ensuring quality

**Pattern 2: Strategy Evaluation**
- Existing Strategy → Kernel Evaluation → Identify Gaps → Strengthen
- **Use when:** Evaluating existing strategy for quality

**Pattern 3: Strategy Execution**
- Kernel Strategy → OKRs → Roadmap → PRDs
- **Use when:** Operationalizing strategy into execution

## Common Pitfalls and Solutions

### Pitfall 1: Diagnosis is Just Description

**What it looks like:**
- "The market is competitive" (observation, not diagnosis)
- "We need to grow faster" (symptom, not challenge)
- "Users aren't engaged" (symptom, not root cause)

**Why it's a problem:**
- Doesn't explain WHY the challenge exists
- Can't develop appropriate response
- Solving symptoms, not root causes
- Strategy will miss the mark

**How to avoid it:**
- Always ask "why?" - dig deeper than surface observations
- Distinguish symptoms from root causes
- Explain what's really going on, not just what you see
- Test: Does your diagnosis point toward a response?

**Example:**
```
Before: "The market is competitive"
After: "Incumbents have network effects making switching costly—our challenge is overcoming switching friction"
Result: Diagnosis explains WHY competition is hard and points toward response (reduce switching costs)
```

### Pitfall 2: Guiding Policy is Generic

**What it looks like:**
- "Deliver great products and excellent service"
- "Be customer-centric and data-driven"
- "Pursue excellence through innovation"

**Why it's a problem:**
- Could apply to any company
- Doesn't create direction or constraints
- Doesn't distinguish your approach
- Can't guide specific actions

**How to avoid it:**
- Be specific about YOUR approach
- Create constraints (what you will/won't do)
- Connect to diagnosis
- Test: Is this different from obvious/generic approaches?

**Example:**
```
Before: "Deliver great products and excellent service"
After: "Win by focusing on underserved power users, even if it means alienating mainstream"
Result: Policy creates clear direction and constraints, distinguishes your approach
```

### Pitfall 3: Actions Aren't Coherent

**What it looks like:**
- Laundry list of good ideas
- Actions that don't connect
- Some actions contradict others
- No clear how actions reinforce each other

**Why it's a problem:**
- Actions work in isolation, not together
- Miss opportunities for coordination
- May work against each other
- Strategy lacks power

**How to avoid it:**
- Ensure each action reinforces others
- Explain how actions work together
- Test: Can you explain how Action A makes Action B more effective?
- Remove actions that don't support guiding policy

**Example:**
```
Before: List of 10 unrelated initiatives
After: 5 coordinated actions that reinforce each other
- Action 1: Build distribution centers
- Action 2: Invest in logistics (makes Action 1 more effective)
- Action 3: Negotiate supplier deals (leverages Actions 1+2)
Result: Actions create power through coordination
```

### Pitfall 4: Skipping Diagnosis

**What it looks like:**
- Jumping straight to "here's what we'll do"
- No clear statement of challenge
- Actions without context
- Can't explain why these actions

**Why it's a problem:**
- No foundation for strategy
- Can't evaluate if approach is right
- Actions may solve wrong problem
- Strategy lacks coherence

**How to avoid it:**
- Force yourself to write diagnosis first
- Test: If someone asks "why are you doing this?" can you point to diagnosis?
- Don't move to policy/actions until diagnosis is clear
- Use diagnosis to validate policy and actions

**Example:**
```
Before: "We'll launch in 5 new markets" (no diagnosis)
After: 
Diagnosis: "Current markets saturated, growth requires expansion"
Policy: "Enter markets where we have competitive advantage"
Actions: "Launch in 5 specific markets where we can win"
Result: Actions flow logically from diagnosis
```

### Pitfall 5: Confusing Kernel with Strategic Plan

**What it looks like:**
- Kernel becomes 50-page document
- Includes detailed execution plans
- Has budgets, timelines, org charts
- Too complex to understand simply

**Why it's a problem:**
- Loses clarity and focus
- Hard to communicate and align
- May include fluff and unnecessary detail
- Defeats purpose of Kernel (simplicity)

**How to avoid it:**
- Keep Kernel simple—1-2 pages maximum
- Focus on the three elements only
- Put execution details in separate plan
- Test: Can you explain it simply?

**Example:**
```
Before: 50-page "strategy" with budgets, org charts, detailed plans
After: 2-page Kernel (Diagnosis, Policy, Actions) + separate execution plan
Result: Clear strategy that can be communicated simply
```

## Best Practices

### Do's

- ✅ **Start with diagnosis** - Always define the challenge first
- ✅ **Test logical connections** - Ensure Diagnosis → Policy → Actions flows logically
- ✅ **Be specific** - Avoid generic statements that could apply to anyone
- ✅ **Keep it simple** - Kernel should fit on 1-2 pages
- ✅ **Face uncomfortable truths** - Don't avoid hard challenges in diagnosis
- ✅ **Create constraints** - Guiding policy should say what you WON'T do
- ✅ **Ensure coherence** - Actions must reinforce each other
- ✅ **Validate with Kernel** - Use to evaluate any strategy document

### Don'ts

- ❌ **Don't skip diagnosis** - Can't have good strategy without understanding challenge
- ❌ **Don't use fluff** - Avoid jargon that masks unclear thinking
- ❌ **Don't confuse goals with strategy** - Goals are what you want, strategy is how you'll get there
- ❌ **Don't make it too complex** - If you can't explain simply, rethink it
- ❌ **Don't ignore connections** - Elements must logically connect
- ❌ **Don't avoid hard truths** - Face uncomfortable challenges in diagnosis
- ❌ **Don't create contradictions** - Actions shouldn't work against each other
- ❌ **Don't use Kernel for creation** - Use Strategy Blocks or Playing to Win first, then validate
