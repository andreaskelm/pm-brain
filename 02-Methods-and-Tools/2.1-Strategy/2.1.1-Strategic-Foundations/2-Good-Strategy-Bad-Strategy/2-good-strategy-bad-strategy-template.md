# Good Strategy/Bad Strategy Templates

## Introduction

This document provides ready-to-use templates for evaluating and building strategy using the Good Strategy/Bad Strategy Kernel framework. Use these templates with the framework guide (`good-strategy-bad-strategy.md`) to evaluate existing strategies or build new ones.

## How to Use These Templates

1. **Evaluation Template**: Use to evaluate any strategy document against the Kernel criteria
2. **Building Strategy Template**: Use to build a new strategy following the Kernel structure

## Evaluation Template: Is This Good Strategy?

Use this checklist to evaluate any strategy document:

### Kernel Completeness Check

**Diagnosis:**
- [ ] Clearly defines the challenge
- [ ] Explains WHY the challenge exists (not just symptoms)
- [ ] Identifies critical factors
- [ ] Can be explained simply

**Guiding Policy:**
- [ ] Flows logically from diagnosis
- [ ] Provides overall approach to challenge
- [ ] Creates direction and constraints
- [ ] Is specific enough to guide action

**Coherent Actions:**
- [ ] Flow from guiding policy
- [ ] Are coordinated and mutually reinforcing
- [ ] Are feasible with available resources
- [ ] Together, address the diagnosed challenge

### Bad Strategy Hallmarks Check

**Is there fluff?**
- [ ] No jargon masking unclear thinking
- [ ] No buzzwords replacing substance
- [ ] Specific and concrete

**Does it face the challenge?**
- [ ] Challenge is clearly stated
- [ ] Uncomfortable truths are confronted
- [ ] Constraints are acknowledged

**Are goals confused with strategy?**
- [ ] Not just ambitious targets
- [ ] Explains HOW to achieve goals
- [ ] Approach is clear

**Are objectives coherent?**
- [ ] Focused (not 20+ priorities)
- [ ] Non-contradictory
- [ ] Achievable with resources

## Template: Building Strategy with the Kernel

```
# [Product/Company] Strategy - Kernel

## DIAGNOSIS: What's really going on?

### The Challenge
[Clear, specific statement of the challenge you face]

### Why This Challenge Exists
[Root causes, not symptoms]

### Critical Factors
[The 2-3 things that matter most in this situation]

### What We've Learned
[Key insights from research, data, market analysis]

---

## GUIDING POLICY: How will we deal with it?

### Overall Approach
[The general direction and principles for addressing the challenge]

### What We Will Do
[The approach we're taking]

### What We Will NOT Do
[Explicit constraints—what we're choosing NOT to pursue]

### Why This Approach
[Logic connecting policy to diagnosis]

---

## COHERENT ACTIONS: Specific coordinated steps

### Action 1: [Name]
**What:** [Specific action]
**Why:** [How it supports guiding policy]
**By when:** [Timeline]
**Owner:** [Who's responsible]

### Action 2: [Name]
**What:** [Specific action]
**Why:** [How it supports guiding policy]
**By when:** [Timeline]
**Owner:** [Who's responsible]

### Action 3: [Name]
**What:** [Specific action]
**Why:** [How it supports guiding policy]
**By when:** [Timeline]
**Owner:** [Who's responsible]

### How Actions Cohere
[Explain how these actions reinforce each other and work toward the same end]

## Coherence Check

**Diagnosis → Policy:**
- [ ] Policy logically addresses diagnosed challenge
- [ ] Policy creates direction based on insights

**Policy → Actions:**
- [ ] Actions implement the guiding policy
- [ ] Actions are coordinated, not random

**Actions → Challenge:**
- [ ] Together, actions overcome the challenge
- [ ] No major gaps in the response

**Internal Coherence:**
- [ ] No contradictory actions
- [ ] Actions mutually reinforce
- [ ] Feasible with resources

## Bad Strategy Check

**Fluff check:**
- [ ] No jargon without substance
- [ ] Concrete and specific
- [ ] Understandable to outsider

**Challenge check:**
- [ ] Challenge clearly stated
- [ ] Not avoiding hard truths
- [ ] Confronts constraints

**Goals check:**
- [ ] Not just targets
- [ ] Explains HOW to achieve
- [ ] Approach is clear

**Objectives check:**
- [ ] Focused priorities
- [ ] Non-contradictory
- [ ] Resource-realistic
