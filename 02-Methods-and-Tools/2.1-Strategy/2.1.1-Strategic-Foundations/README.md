# Strategic Foundations

Use these guides to define long-term direction before you execute. The three core frameworks are complementary:
- **Strategy Blocks** — the process for creating strategy (Chandra/Lenny)
- **Playing to Win** — the strategic choice framework (Lafley/Martin)
- **Good Strategy/Bad Strategy** — evaluation criteria (Rumelt)

**When to use Strategic Foundations:**
- You need to craft or refresh product strategy
- Debates are circular without clear direction
- Disconnect between vision and roadmap decisions
- You want a shared, defensible set of strategic choices

**When strategy might not be needed:**
- Very small teams with clear, shared direction
- One-off projects with fixed scope
- Technical infrastructure work with no strategic choices

## How to use

1) **Braindump & product sense** – capture raw thoughts, assumptions, and biases before frameworks.  
2) **Choose a guide** – Quickstart or full Strategy Blocks; use Playing to Win for choices; Good Strategy to evaluate.  
3) **Form working group** – PM, Eng, Design, Data.  
4) **Work the templates** – in `1-Strategy-Blocks/1-templates/`.  
5) **Run the strategy sprint** – develop pillars and non-goals.  
6) **Operationalize** – map pillars to OKRs and seed the roadmap.  
7) **Reflect** – what changed, what biases you caught, what you’d do differently.

## How to maintain

- **After Strategy Cycle**: Update company strategy doc with new pillars.  
- **Quarterly Reviews**: Check pillar relevance.  
- **Annual Reviews**: Full refresh every 1–2 years.  
- **After Major Changes**: Revisit when market/company shifts.
