# Strategic Foundations

## For Agents: When to Suggest Strategic Foundations

**Trigger conditions:**
- User mentions: "strategy", "strategic direction", "product strategy", "where are we going", "strategic planning", "annual plan"
- User is in: product_sense (after braindump) or execution_mode (when user asks to create strategy)
- Prerequisites: User needs to define or refresh product direction (may have vision but unclear strategy)
- User has: Some thinking about market, competition, or direction (may be incomplete)

**How to introduce:**
- "You need to define or refresh your product strategy. Let's use Strategic Foundations frameworks to create a clear, defensible set of strategic choices."
- "Based on your thinking about [market/direction/challenges], let's structure this as a product strategy that guides decision-making."

**Common mistakes to avoid:**
- Don't suggest Strategy if user already has clear strategy (suggest OKRs/Roadmap to operationalize)
- Don't suggest Strategy if user is exploring individual opportunities (use Opportunity Assessment)
- Don't create strategy that sounds generic (must be specific to user's context)
- Don't skip braindump - strategy requires deep thinking about market, competition, and direction

**When NOT to use Strategic Foundations:**
- User has clear strategy and needs to execute (use OKRs/Roadmap)
- User is evaluating a specific opportunity (use Opportunity Assessment)
- User needs to prioritize features (use Prioritization frameworks)
- User is doing tactical execution (use PRD or execution frameworks)

Use these guides to define long-term direction before you execute. The three core frameworks are complementary:
- **Strategy Blocks** — the process for creating strategy (Chandra/Lenny)
- **Playing to Win** — the strategic choice framework (Lafley/Martin)
- **Good Strategy/Bad Strategy** — evaluation criteria (Rumelt)

**When to use Strategic Foundations:**
- You need to craft or refresh product strategy
- Debates are circular without clear direction
- Disconnect between vision and roadmap decisions
- You want a shared, defensible set of strategic choices

**When strategy might not be needed:**
- Very small teams with clear, shared direction
- One-off projects with fixed scope
- Technical infrastructure work with no strategic choices

### Templates
- In `1-Strategy-Blocks/1-templates/`:

  - `2-design-sprint-brief.md`
  - `3-leadership-interview-guide.md`

  - `8-working-group-charter.md`

## How to use

1) **Braindump & product sense** – capture raw thoughts, assumptions, and biases before frameworks.  
2) **Choose a guide** – Quickstart or full Strategy Blocks; use Playing to Win for choices; Good Strategy to evaluate.  
3) **Form working group** – PM, Eng, Design, Data.  
4) **Work the templates** – in `1-Strategy-Blocks/1-templates/`.  
5) **Run the strategy sprint** – develop pillars and non-goals.  
6) **Operationalize** – map pillars to OKRs and seed the roadmap.  
7) **Reflect** – what changed, what biases you caught, what you’d do differently.

## How to maintain

- **After Strategy Cycle**: Update company strategy doc with new pillars.  
- **Quarterly Reviews**: Check pillar relevance.  
- **Annual Reviews**: Full refresh every 1–2 years.  
- **After Major Changes**: Revisit when market/company shifts.
