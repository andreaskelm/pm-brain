# Playing to Win Framework

**Framework by:** A.G. Lafley (ex-P&G CEO) & Roger Martin (Dean, Rotman School)  
**Published:** Book - *Playing to Win: How Strategy Really Works* (2013)  
**What it is:** Strategic choice framework — 5 cascading questions that position your organization to win

## Overview

Playing to Win treats strategy as a creative act focused on making integrated choices that position your company to win in the marketplace. The framework consists of five interrelated questions (the "Strategic Choice Cascade") that must be answered together to create a coherent, winning strategy.

**Core Definition:** "Strategy is an integrated set of choices that uniquely positions the firm in its industry so as to create sustainable advantage and superior value relative to the competition."

## Step 0: Braindump & Product Sense (Do this first!)

**Before answering the 5 questions, braindump:**
- What does "winning" mean for your product/company? Don't structure yet—just dump everything.
- What does your product sense tell you about where you should focus?
- What assumptions are you making about customers, competition, capabilities?
- What biases might cloud your strategic choices? (Anchoring on current product? Copying competitors?)

**Product sense exercise:**
- If you could only compete in ONE market/segment, which would it be? Why?
- What would make you say "this strategy is obviously wrong"?
- What would make you say "this strategy is obviously right"?

**When to use Playing to Win:**
- Making core strategic choices about markets and positioning
- Company/product at inflection point requiring strategic direction
- Need framework for strategic debate and leadership alignment
- Complement to operational strategy processes (like Strategy Blocks)

**When NOT to use:**
- Tactical prioritization of features (use prioritization frameworks instead)
- Operational execution planning (use roadmaps, OKRs)
- When answers to the 5 questions are already clear and stable

## Core Philosophy

### Playing to Win is NOT a Tactical Framework

Playing to Win is a **strategic choice framework** for making core decisions about markets, positioning, and capabilities. It helps you:

- **Make integrated strategic choices** - Five questions that must work together
- **Position to win** - Not just participate, but actually win in chosen markets
- **Create coherence** - Choices that reinforce each other

**Common misconceptions:**
- ❌ "I'll use Playing to Win to prioritize features" - Use prioritization frameworks instead
- ❌ "The 5 questions are independent" - They must be answered together and iteratively
- ❌ "Strategy is just answering the questions" - Strategy is the integrated set of choices

### Core Principles

**Play to win, not just to play:**
- Mediocrity comes from trying to "participate" rather than win
- Winning is contextual - define what winning means for you
- Aspirational but grounded - ambitious enough to inspire, realistic enough to guide

**Choices must be integrated:**
- Five questions form a cascade - each informs and constrains the others
- Answers must work together - coherence creates power
- Iterative process - revisit questions as you work through cascade

**Make hard choices:**
- Strategy requires saying "no" - can't play everywhere or win on everything
- Explicit constraints - state where you WON'T play and how you WON'T win
- Focus creates advantage

### The Playing to Win Philosophy

Strategy is not about having ambitious goals or comprehensive plans. It's about making a set of integrated choices that position your organization to win. The five questions force you to make explicit choices about aspiration, markets, approach, capabilities, and systems—choices that must work together to create a coherent, winning strategy.

---

## Framework Structure

Playing to Win consists of five cascading questions that form a strategic choice cascade:

### 1. Winning Aspiration

**What it is:** Your organization's purpose and motivating aspiration—what ultimate outcome you're trying to achieve

**Structure:**
- Definition of "winning" (what does success look like?)
- Customer-focused framing
- Inspirational but grounded

**Why it matters:** Sets the ultimate goal and inspires the organization. Without a clear aspiration, you can't make coherent choices about where to play or how to win.

**Example:**
```
Aspiration: "Help women look and feel beautiful at every age"
```

### 2. Where to Play

**What it is:** The choices about which markets, customers, channels, and products to compete in

**Structure:**
- Geography (which markets?)
- Customer segments (which customers?)
- Product categories (which products?)
- Channels (how to reach customers?)

**Why it matters:** Defines the playing field. You can't win everywhere, so you must choose where to compete.

**Example:**
```
Where: Developed markets (US, Europe), Women 25-49, Mass retail channels, Premium skincare products
```

### 3. How to Win

**What it is:** The unique value proposition and approach that will win in chosen markets

**Structure:**
- Value proposition (what makes you different?)
- Competitive advantage (why will you win?)
- Approach (how will you deliver value?)

**Why it matters:** Defines how you'll win in chosen markets. Must work in the "where" you've chosen.

**Example:**
```
How: Science-backed formulations at accessible prices—making premium skincare benefits available to mass market
```

### 4. Core Capabilities

**What it is:** The capabilities you must have or build to execute "how to win"

**Structure:**
- Required capabilities (what must you be great at?)
- Current capabilities (what do you have?)
- Capability gaps (what must you build?)

**Why it matters:** Ensures you can actually execute your "how to win." Must enable your chosen approach.

**Example:**
```
Capabilities: R&D for effective ingredients, Clinical testing, Manufacturing scale, Brand marketing, Retail relationships
```

### 5. Management Systems

**What it is:** The systems, processes, metrics, and incentives that support strategic execution

**Structure:**
- Metrics (how do you measure winning?)
- Processes (how do you make decisions?)
- Resources (how do you allocate budget/people?)
- Incentives (how do you reward execution?)

**Why it matters:** Ensures systems support strategy, not work against it. Must enable capabilities and execution.

**Example:**
```
Systems: Metrics (market share, brand health), Processes (innovation pipeline, quarterly reviews), Resources (R&D budget, marketing spend), Incentives (bonuses tied to market share)
```

### How Questions Connect

The five questions form a cascade where each informs and constrains the others:

```
WINNING ASPIRATION (what are we trying to achieve?)
    ↓ informs
WHERE TO PLAY (which markets/customers?)
    ↓ informs
HOW TO WIN (what's our unique approach?)
    ↓ informs
CORE CAPABILITIES (what must we be great at?)
    ↓ informs
MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS (how do we support execution?)
```

**Each question must be answered AND must connect logically to the others.**

## How to Use This Framework

The five questions must be answered **in order** and **together** — each answer influences and constrains the others. This is an **iterative process**, not a one-time exercise.

### The Strategic Choice Cascade

```
1. WINNING ASPIRATION
   ↓ (informs)
2. WHERE TO PLAY
   ↓ (informs)
3. HOW TO WIN
   ↓ (informs)
4. CORE CAPABILITIES
   ↓ (informs)
5. MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS
```

Each level should be revisited as you work through the cascade. Changes at one level may require adjustments to previous answers.

## How to Maintain

- **Annually**: Full review of all 5 questions
- **Quarterly**: Check if strategic choices still hold true
- **When major changes occur**: Market shifts, competitive moves, technology changes
- **During strategy sprints**: Use to structure strategic planning sessions

---

## Question 1: What is Your Winning Aspiration?

### What It Means
Your organization's purpose and motivating aspiration—what ultimate outcome you're trying to achieve. This is about WINNING, not just participating.

### Key Principles
- **Play to win, not just to play:** Mediocrity comes from trying to "participate" rather than win
- **Winning is contextual:** For some it's market share, for others it's impact, innovation, or specific customer outcomes
- **Aspirational but grounded:** Ambitious enough to inspire, realistic enough to guide choices

### How to Answer
1. **Define what "winning" means for you:**
   - Market leadership? In what?
   - Customer impact? Which customers?
   - Category creation? Which category?
   - Sustainable profitability? At what scale?

2. **Frame it in customer terms:**
   - NOT: "Be the #1 app in our category"
   - YES: "Help busy parents feel confident and prepared every day"

3. **Make it motivating:**
   - Should inspire your team and guide choices
   - Creates clarity about what you're ultimately trying to achieve

### Example Aspirations
- **P&G Olay:** "Help women look and feel beautiful at every age"
- **Headspace (from Strategy Blocks):** "Improve the health and happiness of the world"
- **Generic SaaS:** "Be the trusted operating system for [target customer] teams"

### Common Mistakes
- ❌ Too vague: "Be the best company"
- ❌ Just financial: "Achieve $100M revenue"
- ❌ Too tactical: "Launch in 5 countries"
- ✅ Aspirational + specific: "Be the #1 choice for [specific customer need] in [specific market]"

### Test Your Answer
- Does it clarify what we're trying to achieve?
- Does it force choices about where to focus?
- Would losing this aspiration mean we've failed?

---

## Question 2: Where Will You Play?

### What It Means
The specific playing field(s) where you will compete to achieve your aspiration. This is about **choosing** where to focus, which means choosing where **NOT** to play.

### Four Dimensions to Consider

**1. Geography**
- Which countries, regions, cities?
- Example: "Focus on US first, then expand to English-speaking markets"

**2. Product/Service Type**
- Which products or services will you offer?
- Example: "Guided meditation only, not sleep content or fitness"

**3. Customer Segment**
- Which customers will you serve?
- Example: "Busy professionals 25-45, not retirees or students"

**4. Distribution Channel**
- How will you reach customers?
- Example: "Direct-to-consumer app, not through healthcare providers"

### How to Answer
1. **List all possible playing fields** across the 4 dimensions
2. **Evaluate each against your aspiration:** Does this field help us win?
3. **Make hard choices:** Pick 2-3 fields maximum (for startups: often just 1)
4. **Explicitly state where you WON'T play**

### Example Choices
- **P&G Olay:** Premium skincare, mass retail channels, women 25-49, developed markets
- **NOT:** Budget skincare, medical channels, teens, emerging markets (initially)

### Common Mistakes
- ❌ "We serve everyone": Trying to be everything to everyone
- ❌ "We'll expand everywhere": No focus or prioritization
- ❌ Not stating where you WON'T play: Leaves door open to dilution
- ✅ "We will play here, and explicitly NOT play there"

### Test Your Answer
- Have we made hard choices to focus resources?
- Can we win in these chosen spaces?
- Is it clear what we're saying NO to?

---

## Question 3: How Will You Win?

### What It Means
Your value proposition—how you will create value superior to competitors in your chosen playing field. This is the **heart of strategy**.

### Two Primary Strategies

**1. Cost Leadership**
- Deliver similar value at lower cost
- Requires operational excellence, scale, efficiency
- Example: Walmart, IKEA

**2. Differentiation**
- Deliver unique value customers will pay premium for
- Requires innovation, brand, unique capabilities
- Example: Apple, Tesla

### How to Answer
1. **Analyze the competitive landscape in your chosen playing field:**
   - Who are the current winners?
   - What are their strengths/weaknesses?
   - What do customers value most?

2. **Identify your potential advantage:**
   - What can you do that competitors can't or won't?
   - What unique insight do you have about customers?
   - What can you do better, faster, or differently?

3. **Frame your "how to win":**
   - Should be specific to your playing field
   - Should leverage your unique strengths
   - Should be defensible (hard for competitors to copy)

### Example "How to Win"
- **P&G Olay:** "Win through science-backed formulations at accessible price points, making premium skincare accessible to mass market women"
- **Headspace:** "Win through approachable, non-religious guided meditation that makes mindfulness accessible to beginners"

### Common Mistakes
- ❌ Generic: "Better product and service"
- ❌ Unrealistic: "Win on price AND premium quality AND speed"
- ❌ Not differentiated: "Do what everyone else does, but better"
- ✅ Specific and defensible: "Win through [unique approach] that creates [specific value] for [specific customers]"

### Test Your Answer
- Is this truly differentiated from competitors?
- Can we actually deliver this advantage?
- Will customers value this enough to choose us?
- Can we sustain this advantage over time?

---

## Question 4: What Capabilities Must Be in Place?

### What It Means
The set of activities and competencies required to deliver your "how to win." These flow directly from your choices about where to play and how to win.

### Types of Capabilities
- **Activities:** What you do (R&D, manufacturing, distribution, marketing)
- **Competencies:** What you're good at (design, data analysis, customer service)
- **Resources:** What you have (brand, technology, partnerships, data)

### How to Answer
1. **Work backward from "how to win":**
   - If we're winning through X, what capabilities enable that?

2. **Identify gaps:**
   - What capabilities do we have?
   - What capabilities do we need?
   - What's the gap?

3. **Prioritize:**
   - Which capabilities are must-haves vs. nice-to-haves?
   - Which can we build vs. buy vs. partner for?

### Example Capabilities (P&G Olay)
Required to win through "science-backed formulations at accessible prices":
- **R&D capability:** Develop effective anti-aging formulations
- **Manufacturing:** Produce at scale while maintaining quality
- **Clinical testing:** Validate claims with science
- **Brand marketing:** Communicate benefits to mass market
- **Retail relationships:** Get shelf space at target stores

### Common Mistakes
- ❌ Listing everything you do: Not prioritizing critical capabilities
- ❌ Ignoring capability gaps: Assuming you can magically do anything
- ❌ Not connecting to "how to win": Listing generic "good to have" capabilities
- ✅ Specific capabilities directly enabling your strategy

### Test Your Answer
- Do these capabilities directly enable our "how to win"?
- Can we realistically build/acquire these capabilities?
- Have we prioritized the most critical ones?

---

## Question 5: What Management Systems Are Required?

### What It Means
The systems, measures, and processes that support your strategic choices and enable your capabilities. These ensure the strategy is executed and measured.

### Types of Management Systems
- **Measurement systems:** Metrics and dashboards
- **Operating processes:** How work gets done
- **Decision-making processes:** How choices are made
- **Resource allocation:** How budget/people are assigned
- **Incentive systems:** How performance is rewarded

### How to Answer
1. **Identify what needs measurement:**
   - Leading indicators of "winning"
   - Capability development metrics
   - Strategic health metrics

2. **Design processes that reinforce strategy:**
   - Decision processes that favor strategic choices
   - Resource allocation aligned to strategic priorities
   - Operating rhythms that maintain strategic focus

3. **Create accountability:**
   - Who owns each strategic pillar?
   - How do we track progress?
   - How do we course-correct?

### Example Management Systems (P&G Olay)
To support "science-backed at accessible prices":
- **Measurement:** Clinical trial results, cost-to-produce, customer satisfaction, market share by channel
- **Processes:** Annual innovation pipeline review, quarterly brand health checks
- **Resource allocation:** R&D budget prioritization, marketing spend allocation
- **Incentives:** Bonuses tied to market share growth and margin targets

### Common Mistakes
- ❌ Generic KPIs not tied to strategy: "Revenue, users, engagement"
- ❌ Too many metrics: Measuring everything
- ❌ Systems that work against strategy: Incentives that contradict strategic choices
- ✅ Focused systems directly supporting strategic execution

### Test Your Answer
- Do these systems reinforce our strategic choices?
- Will we know if we're winning or losing?
- Can we act on what we measure?

---

## Bringing It All Together

### The Integration Test
Answer all 5 questions, then check for coherence:

**Vertical coherence (top to bottom):**
- Does "where to play" support our aspiration?
- Does "how to win" work in our chosen playing field?
- Do our capabilities enable our "how to win"?
- Do our systems support our capabilities?

**Horizontal coherence (across choices):**
- Are there contradictions? (e.g., "win on cost" but "capabilities require premium pricing")
- Are there gaps? (e.g., "how to win" requires capabilities we can't build)
- Are there conflicts? (e.g., systems incentivize behavior counter to strategy)

### Iterative Refinement
1. Answer all 5 questions with first draft
2. Test for coherence
3. Revise answers based on conflicts/gaps
4. Repeat until integrated and coherent

### Nested Cascades (for larger organizations)
- **Company level:** Overall strategic choices
- **Business unit level:** Choices within company constraints
- **Product level:** Choices within BU constraints
- **Feature level:** Choices within product constraints

Each level influences and is influenced by levels above and below.

## Decision Tree: When to Use Playing to Win vs. Other Frameworks

```
START: Need strategic direction?
│
├─ Need step-by-step PROCESS for creating strategy?
│  └─ Use STRATEGY BLOCKS (operational process)
│
├─ Need FRAMEWORK for strategic choices?
│  └─ Use PLAYING TO WIN (this framework)
│
├─ Need to EVALUATE if strategy is good?
│  └─ Use GOOD STRATEGY/BAD STRATEGY (evaluation criteria)
│
└─ Need to EXECUTE strategy?
   └─ Use OKRs + Roadmap + Prioritization
```

## Integration with Other Frameworks

### Combining Playing to Win with Strategy Blocks

**When to combine:** When creating strategy using operational process

**How they work together:**
- Strategy Blocks provides step-by-step process for creating strategy
- Playing to Win questions structure Strategy Sprint (Step 2 of Strategy Blocks)
- Playing to Win provides framework for strategic choices
- Strategy Blocks provides process for executing those choices

**Example workflow:**
```
Step 1: Use Strategy Blocks preparation phase (gather inputs)
Step 2: Use Playing to Win questions during Strategy Sprint:
  - Answer 5 questions to make strategic choices
  - Iterate to ensure coherence
Step 3: Use Strategy Blocks to develop and document strategy
Step 4: Use Good Strategy Kernel to evaluate output
```

### Combining Playing to Win with Good Strategy/Bad Strategy

**When to combine:** When validating strategic choices

**How they work together:**
- Playing to Win provides framework for making choices
- Good Strategy Kernel provides evaluation criteria
- Playing to Win answers map to Kernel elements
- Kernel validates coherence of Playing to Win choices

**Example workflow:**
```
Step 1: Answer Playing to Win 5 questions
Step 2: Map answers to Kernel:
  - Diagnosis: Emerges from "where to play" and "how to win" analysis
  - Guiding Policy: The "how to win" choice
  - Coherent Actions: Flow from "capabilities" and "systems"
Step 3: Validate Kernel coherence
```

### Combining Playing to Win with OKRs

**When to combine:** When operationalizing strategic choices into measurable outcomes

**How they work together:**
- Playing to Win defines strategic choices
- OKRs operationalize choices into measurable outcomes
- Objectives should align to "winning aspiration"
- Key Results should measure progress on "how to win"

**Example workflow:**
```
Step 1: Answer Playing to Win 5 questions
Step 2: Create OKRs that operationalize choices:
  - Objectives align to winning aspiration
  - Key Results measure progress on "how to win" in chosen "where"
Step 3: Track OKR progress to validate strategic execution
```

### Combining Playing to Win with Roadmaps

**When to combine:** When building roadmaps that execute strategic choices

**How they work together:**
- Playing to Win defines where to play and how to win
- Roadmaps define initiatives that execute those choices
- Roadmap initiatives should build required capabilities
- Roadmap priorities informed by "how to win"

**Example workflow:**
```
Step 1: Answer Playing to Win questions
Step 2: Identify initiatives that build core capabilities
Step 3: Prioritize initiatives that support "how to win"
Step 4: Build roadmap with prioritized initiatives
```

### Typical Integration Patterns

**Pattern 1: Strategy Creation**
- Strategy Blocks (process) + Playing to Win (choices) → Good Strategy Kernel (validation) → OKRs → Roadmap
- **Use when:** Creating new strategy from scratch

**Pattern 2: Strategic Choices**
- Playing to Win (choices) → Good Strategy Kernel (validation) → OKRs
- **Use when:** Making core strategic choices about markets/positioning

**Pattern 3: Strategy Execution**
- Playing to Win (choices) → OKRs → Roadmap → PRDs
- **Use when:** Operationalizing strategic choices into execution

## Common Pitfalls and Solutions

### Pitfall 1: Answering Questions in Isolation

**What it looks like:**
- Answer each question independently
- Choices don't connect or support each other
- "Where to play" doesn't support "winning aspiration"
- "How to win" doesn't work in chosen "where"

**Why it's a problem:**
- Strategy lacks coherence
- Choices work against each other
- Can't execute effectively
- Strategy won't create advantage

**How to avoid it:**
- Iterate through all 5 questions multiple times
- Check coherence after each iteration
- Ensure each answer informs and constrains others
- Test: Do choices reinforce each other?

**Example:**
```
Before: 
- Aspiration: "Win in enterprise market"
- Where: "SMB market" (doesn't support aspiration)
- How: "Low price" (doesn't work for enterprise)

After:
- Aspiration: "Win in enterprise market"
- Where: "Enterprise market, Fortune 500 companies"
- How: "Premium features and white-glove service" (works for enterprise)
Result: Choices are coherent and reinforce each other
```

### Pitfall 2: Not Making Hard Choices

**What it looks like:**
- "We'll play everywhere and win on everything"
- No explicit constraints
- Trying to serve all customers
- Competing on all dimensions

**Why it's a problem:**
- Dilutes focus and resources
- Can't excel at anything
- No clear advantage
- Guarantees mediocrity

**How to avoid it:**
- Force yourself to explicitly state where you WON'T play
- State how you WON'T win (what you're choosing not to do)
- Use "not now" list for excluded markets/approaches
- Test: Can you clearly state what you're NOT doing?

**Example:**
```
Before: "We'll serve all customers with all features"
After: 
- Where: "Enterprise customers only" (explicitly NOT SMB)
- How: "Premium features and service" (explicitly NOT low price)
- Won't play: SMB market, low-price segment
Result: Clear focus enables advantage
```

### Pitfall 3: Confusing Goals with Strategy

**What it looks like:**
- "Our strategy is to grow 50%"
- "Our strategy is to achieve $100M revenue"
- Stating outcomes without explaining HOW

**Why it's a problem:**
- Goals aren't strategy - strategy is HOW you'll achieve goals
- No guidance for making choices
- Can't evaluate if approach is right
- Strategy becomes wishful thinking

**How to avoid it:**
- Separate goals from strategy
- Goals are outcomes, strategy is the approach
- Answer HOW you'll achieve goals through the 5 questions
- Test: Can you explain HOW you'll achieve the goal?

**Example:**
```
Before: "Our strategy is to grow 50%"
After:
- Goal: Grow 50%
- Strategy: Win in enterprise market (where) by offering premium features (how) that leverage our R&D capabilities
Result: Clear approach to achieving goal
```

### Pitfall 4: Ignoring Capabilities

**What it looks like:**
- Strategy requires capabilities you don't have
- "How to win" needs capabilities you can't build
- Unrealistic about what you can actually do
- Capabilities don't enable "how to win"

**Why it's a problem:**
- Can't execute strategy
- Strategy becomes fantasy
- Wastes resources trying to build impossible capabilities
- Strategy fails in execution

**How to avoid it:**
- Reality-check capabilities before committing to strategy
- Assess current capabilities honestly
- Identify capability gaps early
- Adjust "how to win" if capabilities don't support it

**Example:**
```
Before: "How to win: AI-powered personalization" but no AI capabilities
After: 
- Current capabilities: Data analytics, customer insights
- How to win: "Data-driven personalization using existing analytics" (realistic)
- Build toward: AI capabilities over time
Result: Strategy is executable with current capabilities
```

### Pitfall 5: Systems Work Against Strategy

**What it looks like:**
- Incentives reward behavior counter to strategic choices
- Metrics measure wrong things
- Processes don't support strategy
- Resources allocated to non-strategic work

**Why it's a problem:**
- Organization works against strategy
- Strategy can't be executed
- Teams optimize for wrong things
- Strategy fails despite good choices

**How to avoid it:**
- Align all systems to strategy
- Ensure metrics measure strategic progress
- Design processes to support strategic execution
- Align incentives to reward strategic behavior

**Example:**
```
Before: Strategy says "win in enterprise" but incentives reward SMB sales
After:
- Strategy: Win in enterprise
- Metrics: Enterprise revenue, enterprise customer satisfaction
- Incentives: Bonuses tied to enterprise metrics
- Resources: Sales team focused on enterprise
Result: Systems support strategy execution
```

## Best Practices

### Do's

- ❌ **Don't confuse goals with strategy** - Goals are outcomes, strategy is approach
- ❌ **Don't ignore capabilities** - Strategy must be executable
- ❌ **Don't let systems work against strategy** - Align everything to strategy
- ❌ **Don't be vague** - Specific choices create advantage
- ❌ **Don't skip questions** - All 5 must be answered
- ❌ **Don't set-and-forget** - Review choices regularly as context changes

## Real-World Example: P&G Olay Transformation

### Context
Olay (formerly "Oil of Olay") was seen as "Oil of Old Lady"—outdated brand for aging women.

### The Strategic Cascade

**1. Winning Aspiration**
Help women look and feel beautiful at every age

**2. Where to Play**
- Geography: Developed markets (US, Europe) first
- Product: Premium skincare (anti-aging focus)
- Customers: Women 25-49, mass market
- Channel: Mass retail (drugstores, supermarkets)

**3. How to Win**
Science-backed formulations at accessible prices—making premium skincare benefits available to mass market women

**4. Core Capabilities**
- R&D: Develop effective anti-aging ingredients
- Clinical testing: Validate "fights 7 signs of aging"
- Manufacturing: Scale production while maintaining quality
- Brand marketing: Reposition from "old lady" to "ageless beauty"
- Retail relationships: Premium shelf space at mass retailers

**5. Management Systems**
- Metrics: Clinical trial results, brand health tracking, market share by channel
- Processes: Annual innovation pipeline, quarterly brand reviews
- Resources: Increased R&D budget, premium marketing spend
- Incentives: Bonuses tied to market share growth in target demographic

**Result:**
Olay transformed from declining brand to $2B+ global franchise, market leader in mass-market anti-aging.

**Key lesson:**
All five choices worked together—each one reinforced the others, creating a coherent strategy.
