# Strategic Foundations

Frameworks for long-term strategic direction. Use these to define WHERE you're going before executing with OKRs, Roadmaps, and Prioritization.

## The Three Frameworks

### 1. Strategy Blocks (Chandra Janakiraman)
**What:** Step-by-step process for creating product strategy
**When:** Need to run a strategy creation process (8-12 weeks)
**Output:** 2-year strategy doc + 3/5/10-year aspirational futures
**Best for:** Operational leaders who need to actually WRITE strategy

### 2. Playing to Win (Lafley/Martin)
**What:** 5 cascading questions for strategic choices
**When:** Making core strategic decisions (where to play, how to win)
**Output:** Answers to 5 key strategic questions
**Best for:** Strategic debate and alignment on choices

### 3. Good Strategy/Bad Strategy (Rumelt)
**What:** The "Kernel" - Diagnosis → Policy → Actions
**When:** Evaluating if strategy is good, or diagnosing why it's failing
**Output:** Criteria for good strategy
**Best for:** Teaching teams what good strategy looks like

## How to Use Them Together

**Scenario 1: Creating Strategy from Scratch**
1. Start with **Strategy Blocks** (the process)
2. Use **Playing to Win** questions during Strategy Sprint (step 2)
3. Evaluate output with **Good Strategy Kernel** (does it have all 3 parts?)

**Scenario 2: Evaluating Existing Strategy**
1. Start with **Good Strategy** - does our strategy have the kernel?
2. If missing diagnosis → run Strategy Blocks step 1 (Preparation)
3. If missing choices → use Playing to Win questions

**Scenario 3: Quick Strategic Refresh**
1. Use **Playing to Win** for focused strategic discussion
2. Validate with **Good Strategy** criteria
3. (Skip Strategy Blocks if short on time)

## When to Use Which

| Need | Use This |
|------|----------|
| Full strategy creation process | Strategy Blocks |
| Strategic choices framework | Playing to Win |
| Evaluate if strategy is good | Good Strategy Kernel |
| Team alignment on direction | Strategy Blocks |
| Quick strategic refresh | Playing to Win |
| Teach what good strategy is | Good Strategy Kernel |

## What's NOT Here

These frameworks are about STRATEGIC DIRECTION, not execution.

**For execution, see:**
- `2.1.2-Strategic-Execution/` - OKRs, Roadmaps, North Star, Prioritization
- `2.4-Execution/` - PRDs, Personas, etc.
