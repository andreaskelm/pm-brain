- Set expectations for afternoon

**Afternoon Session: Problem Identification (1 PM - 5 PM)**

**1:00-1:10 PM: Problem Brainstorm Instructions**
```
Facilitator Script:
"Now we translate insights into problems. Write specific problems on sticky notes:
- One problem per sticky note
- Problems, not solutions ('Users can't find features' not 'Add search')
- Be specific ('New users abandon at step 3' not 'onboarding is hard')
- Focus on problems preventing growth or user success
- Aim for 15-30 problems each
- Work silently for next 90 minutes"
```

**Problem Statement Examples:**
- ✅ Good: "Enterprise users can't integrate with their existing SSO systems"
- ❌ Too vague: "Integration is hard"
- ❌ Solution-focused: "We need better SSO"

- ✅ Good: "Users abandon onboarding after creating account but before first action"
- ❌ Too broad: "Onboarding doesn't work"
- ❌ Solution: "Simplify onboarding"

**1:10-2:40 PM: Individual Problem Brainstorm**
- Work in silence
- Facilitator walks around, ensures people write problems not solutions
- Give 30-minute and 10-minute warnings

**2:40-3:40 PM: Problem Sharing**
- Each person reads their problems aloud (1 minute max per problem)
- No discussion or judgment—just clarifying questions
- Post sticky notes on wall as they're shared
- Group similar problems loosely as you go

**3:40-3:55 PM: Break**

**3:55-5:00 PM: Initial Clustering**
- Work together to group related problems
- Move sticky notes into clusters
- Give each cluster a descriptive name
- Aim for 10-15 clusters total
- Don't worry about perfect categorization

**Clustering Facilitation Tips:**
- Start with obvious groupings
- Ask "Are these really the same problem or different problems?"
- Keep clusters focused—split if they get too broad
- Name clusters with user or business language, not technical jargon

**End of Day Check:**
- Do we have 50-150 total problems?
- Are they clustered into 10-15 themes?
- Do cluster names make sense to everyone?
- Any obvious gaps or overlaps?

#### Day 2: Strategy Selection (9 AM - 5 PM)

**Morning Session: Opportunity Framing (9 AM - 12 PM)**

**9:00-10:00 AM: Cluster Refinement**
- Review yesterday's clusters with fresh eyes
- Merge overlapping clusters
- Split overly broad clusters
- Aim for 8-12 final opportunity areas

**Cluster Quality Checks:**
- Is each cluster focused on one core opportunity?
- Are the problems in each cluster really related?
- Do the cluster names clearly communicate the opportunity?

**10:00-10:15 AM: Break**

**10:15-11:15 AM: Flip Problems to Opportunities**
Transform each problem cluster into an opportunity area:

**Examples:**
- "Users can't find advanced features" → **"Discovery & Findability"**
- "New users abandon during setup" → **"Onboarding & Activation"**
- "Enterprise customers need integrations" → **"Platform & Extensibility"**
- "App is slow and unreliable" → **"Performance & Reliability"**

**Opportunity Framing Guidelines:**
- Use positive, forward-looking language
- Focus on user or business value creation

- Avoid technical jargon

**11:15 AM-12:00 PM: Scoring Framework Deep Dive**
- Review 4-dimension scoring system in detail
- Walk through examples for each dimension
- Practice scoring one opportunity area together
- Distribute individual scoring sheets

**Afternoon Session: Scoring & Selection (1 PM - 5 PM)**

**1:00-2:45 PM: Individual Scoring**
```
Facilitator Instructions:
"Score each opportunity area 1-5 on all 4 dimensions:
- Use evidence from this morning's presentations
- Write brief notes explaining your scores
- Work independently—no discussion
- Take your time—this determines our strategy"
```

**Individual Scoring Sheet Template:**
```
Opportunity Area: ________________________

Expected Impact (1-5): ___
Evidence: ________________________________

Evidence: ________________________________

Total Score: ___
```

**2:45-3:00 PM: Break**

**3:00-4:30 PM: Group Discussion & Consensus**

**Process for Each Opportunity Area (15 minutes each):**
1. **Share Scores (3 min):** Everyone shares their 4 scores
2. **Identify Gaps (2 min):** Note differences of 2+ points
3. **Discuss Evidence (8 min):** Highest and lowest scorers explain reasoning
4. **Reach Consensus (2 min):** Agree on final scores

**Facilitation Tips:**
- Keep discussions focused on evidence, not opinions
- Ask "What evidence supports that score?"
- Look for patterns across multiple scorers
- Don't let perfect be enemy of good—rough consensus is fine

**4:30-5:00 PM: Pillar Selection & Sanity Check**
- Calculate total scores for each opportunity area
- Rank by total score
- Select top 3-5 as strategic pillars
- Sanity check: "Do these feel right as our focus?"

**Final Selection Questions:**

- 3-5 strategic pillars with scores and rationale
- Clear evidence base supporting each pillar
- Documented reasoning for selection decisions

#### Day 3: Winning Aspiration & Development (9 AM - 5 PM)

**Morning Session: Winning Aspiration (9 AM - 12 PM)**

**9:00-9:15 AM: Creative Exercise Setup**
```
Facilitator Script:
"Imagine it's exactly 2 years from today. We've made incredible progress on all our strategic pillars. A journalist is writing about our success story.

What's the headline? Focus on:
- How users' lives are better
- How our business has grown
- What makes this remarkable or noteworthy
- Specific, concrete outcomes"
```

**9:15-10:00 AM: Individual Headline Creation**
Each person writes 3-5 potential headlines:

**Headline Examples:**
- "TechCorp Becomes Go-To Platform as 90% of New Users Activate Core Features in First Week"
- "How EduApp Transformed from Content Library to Teacher's Primary Workspace in 10,000+ Schools"
- "The Discovery Revolution: How DesignTool Made Advanced Features Accessible to Non-Designers"

**Headlines Should Answer:**
- What changed for users?
- What business milestone did we achieve?
- Why is this newsworthy?

**10:00-10:15 AM: Break**

**10:15-11:15 AM: Headline Sharing & Synthesis**
- Each person shares their headlines (no judgment)
- Post all headlines on wall
- Identify common themes and powerful language
- Note phrases that capture both user value and business success

**Common Themes to Look For:**
- User behavior changes
- Business growth metrics
- Market position shifts
- Problem-solving breakthroughs

**11:15 AM-12:00 PM: Aspiration Selection & Refinement**
- Combine best elements from different headlines
- Create 2-3 candidate aspirations
- Test each: Does it inspire? Is it believable? Does it connect to pillars?
- Select and refine final 2-year winning aspiration

**Quality Checks:**
- Is it inspiring but believable?
- Does it connect to all our pillars?
- Would users and employees both care?
- Is it specific enough to guide decisions?

**Afternoon Session: Pillar Development (1 PM - 5 PM)**

**1:00-2:30 PM: "How Might We" Generation**

**For Each Strategic Pillar (20 minutes per pillar):**
- Generate 3-5 "How Might We" statements
- Focus on solution approaches, not specific features
- Make them actionable and inspiring

**"How Might We" Examples:**
- Discovery Pillar: "How might we make feature discovery feel like treasure hunting?"
- Onboarding Pillar: "How might we get users to their first success in under 5 minutes?"
- Platform Pillar: "How might we make integration setup feel effortless?"

**2:30-2:45 PM: Break**

**2:45-4:00 PM: Success Metrics Brainstorm**

**For Each Pillar, Identify:**

**Primary Metrics (direct measures):**
- Discovery: % users who find and use advanced features within 30 days
- Onboarding: % users who complete core workflow in first session
- Platform: # active integrations per customer

**Secondary Metrics (supporting indicators):**
- Discovery: Search success rate, feature page views
- Onboarding: Time to first value, tutorial completion rate
- Platform: API calls per customer, developer documentation usage

**Guardrail Metrics (what we can't break):**
- Overall user satisfaction scores
- Performance/reliability metrics
- Support ticket volume

**4:00-5:00 PM: Risk & Assumption Documentation**

**For Each Pillar, Capture:**

**Key Assumptions:**
- Discovery: Users want to use advanced features (not just know about them)
- Onboarding: Current drop-off is due to complexity, not lack of need
- Platform: Customers will pay for integration capabilities

**Biggest Risks:**
- Discovery: Making interface more complex while trying to improve findability
- Onboarding: Over-simplifying and removing needed functionality
- Platform: Technical complexity exceeds team capabilities

**Early Tests:**
- Discovery: A/B test improved navigation with small user group
- Onboarding: Prototype simplified flow with new user interviews
- Platform: Survey enterprise customers about integration priorities

**Day 3 Outputs:**
- Inspiring 2-year winning aspiration
- "How Might We" statements for each pillar
- Success metrics framework (primary, secondary, guardrail)
- Risk assessment and early testing ideas
