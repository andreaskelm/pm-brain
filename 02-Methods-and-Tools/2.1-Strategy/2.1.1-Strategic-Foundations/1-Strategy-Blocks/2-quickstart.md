# Product Strategy — Quickstart

## Basics
**What it is:** Strategy sits between mission/vision and plan/roadmap. Forces choices to deploy scarce resources for maximum impact by selecting 3–5 strategic pillars and explicit non-goals.

**Why it matters:** Aligns teams on "why these bets," reduces unproductive debates, and connects daily work to business outcomes.

**When you need it:** Teams are confused about project priorities, debates are circular, or there's a disconnect between vision and roadmap decisions.

## Prerequisites Checklist
- [ ] Leadership commitment for 8-12 week process
- [ ] Working group availability (PM + Eng + Design + Data leads)
- [ ] Access to user data, research, and analytics
- [ ] Calendar blocked for strategy sprint week (all working group members)

## Small "s" Strategy (2-year) — 5 Steps

### Step 1: Preparation (3–5 weeks, part-time)

**Core Working Group:** PM (owner), Engineering Lead, Design Lead, Data Lead
**Optional:** Product Marketing, User Research, Content Design

**Key Deliverables:**

#### Data Lead: Behavioral Insights Pack
- Meta-analysis of past behavioral studies and usage data
- User segment analysis and key usage patterns
- Performance metrics baseline (reliability, latency, cost)
- Identify critical gaps needing new analysis

#### Design Lead: UX Research Synthesis  
- Meta-analysis of qualitative and quantitative research
- Key user needs, frustrations, and unmet desires
- User journey pain points and moments of delight
- Commission scrappy studies for critical gaps (5 user interviews max)

#### PM + Working Group: Leadership Interviews (45-60 min each)
**Essential Questions:**
1. "What does success look like in 2 years? What does failure look like?"
2. "What are the most important measures of success?"
3. "What principles should guide our product decisions?"
4. "Why haven't things worked in the past?"
5. "What pet ideas should we consider?"

**Pro Tip:** Distribute interviews across working group members. Capture verbatim quotes.

#### PM/PMM: Competitive & Comparables Analysis
**Required Components:**
- Feature comparison heatmap with color coding
- Investment themes: where competitors are focusing R&D
- Positioning analysis: how each player talks about the problem
- White space opportunities: unmet needs no one addresses well

#### All Members: User Observation (1-3 sessions each)
- Watch user interviews or observe user sessions
- Focus on building empathy, not gathering insights
- Note emotional reactions and language users employ
- Ground strategy in human reality, not just data

#### PM + Eng Lead: Constraints Assessment
- Technical constraints and platform limitations
- Resource constraints and team capacity
- Compliance requirements (legal, regulatory, security)
- Business constraints (partnerships, brand guidelines)

**End of Preparation:** Consolidated insights deck (substance over polish)

### Step 2: Strategy Sprint (1 week) ⭐ **Most Critical**

**Day 1: Share-outs & Problem Identification**

**Morning (9 AM - 12 PM):** Present all preparation deliverables
- 30 min per major section with Q&A
- Focus on top 3 surprising findings from each area
- Take notes on problems affecting users or preventing growth

**Afternoon (1 PM - 5 PM):** Problem Generation
- **Individual Brainstorm:** Each person writes 15-30 problem statements on sticky notes
- **Problem Sharing:** Present problems (1 min each), post on wall
- **Initial Clustering:** Group similar problems, name clusters (10-15 clusters)

**Day 2: Strategy Selection** 🎯 **Single Most Important Day**

**Morning (9 AM - 12 PM):**
- **Refine Clusters:** Merge/split to get 8-12 opportunity areas
- **Flip to Opportunities:** "Users can't find features" → "Discovery & Findability"
- **Review Scoring Framework:** Understand 4 dimensions

**4-Dimension Scoring Framework (1-5 scale each):**

1. **Expected Impact:** User base affected × frequency × pain/value level
2. **Certainty of Impact:** Strength of supporting evidence
3. **Clarity of Levers:** How clear the solution approaches are  
4. **Uniqueness of Levers:** Competitive advantages enabling differentiation ⭐ *Critical 4th dimension*

**Afternoon (1 PM - 5 PM):**
- **Individual Scoring:** Each member scores all opportunity areas
- **Group Discussion:** Reach consensus on scores with evidence
- **Pillar Selection:** Top 3-5 scoring areas become strategic pillars
- **Sanity Check:** Does this portfolio feel right strategically?

**Day 3: Winning Aspiration & Development**

**Morning (9 AM - 12 PM):** Create 2-Year Winning Aspiration
- **Creative Exercise:** "Journalist headline in 2 years after we succeed"
- **Individual Headlines:** Each person writes 3-5 options
- **Synthesis:** Blend best elements into inspiring, believable aspiration

**Afternoon (1 PM - 5 PM):** Pillar Development
- **"How Might We" Statements:** 3-5 per pillar to spark ideation
- **Success Metrics:** Primary, secondary, and guardrail metrics per pillar
- **Risks & Assumptions:** What has to be true? What could prevent success?

### Step 3: Design Sprint (1 week)

**Goal:** Create 1-2 illustrative concepts per strategic pillar

**Team:** Design lead facilitates, working group participates

**Key Principle:** Concepts are for understanding strategy, NOT "shovel-ready" specs

**Process:**
- **Day 1:** Review pillars, divergent concept sketching
- **Day 2:** Refine concepts, create storyboards  
- **Day 3:** Before/after scenarios, low-fi mockups
- **Day 4-5:** Polish artifacts, prepare presentation

**Outputs:** Visual concepts that make each pillar tangible and understandable

### Step 4: Document Writing (1–2 weeks)

**Owner:** PM (primarily solo work)

**Document Structure:**
1. **Executive Summary** (1 page): Context, pillars, aspiration, bottom line
2. **Context/Why Now** (1-2 pages): Current situation, why these choices now
3. **Strategic Pillars** (2-3 pages each): Definition, rationale, vision, concepts, metrics, risks
4. **Non-Goals** (1 page): What we explicitly WON'T focus on
5. **2-Year Winning Aspiration** (0.5 pages): Inspirational vision
6. **Success Measurement** (1 page): Metrics definitions, baselines, targets
7. **Dependencies & Risks** (1 page): Critical dependencies, mitigation strategies
8. **Next Steps** (0.5 pages): Immediate actions, decision criteria

**Quality Checks:**
- **Clarity:** Can newcomer understand why these pillars?
- **Defensibility:** Would skeptical stakeholder be convinced?
- **Actionability:** Can teams build roadmaps from this?

### Step 5: Rollout (2–3 weeks)

**Week 1: Gatekeeper Alignment**
- **1:1 Reviews:** CEO, direct manager, key functional leaders
- **Process:** Send doc 2 days prior, 60-90 min meetings
- **Adjustments:** Minor language changes OK, major pillar changes require strong evidence

**Week 2: Group Review**
- **Stakeholder Meeting:** All gatekeepers + functional leaders + adjacent teams
- **Focus:** Clarification, not re-debating pillar selection
- **Goal:** Explicit commitment: "Can you support this direction?"

**Week 3: Team Roadshows & Operationalization**
- **Roadshow Format:** 8-10 people, 60 minutes per session
- **Agenda:** Why strategy now → Pillar walkthrough → Impact on daily work
- **Operationalization:** 
  - Map pillars → OKRs and dashboards
  - Seed roadmap with pillar-supporting initiatives
  - Create decision framework: "How does this support our pillars?"

## Big "S" Strategy (3/5/10-year) — 5 Steps

**Owner:** Senior Design Lead (typically)
**Timeline:** 4-6 months  
**Focus:** Aspirational futures, not current product problems

1. **Prep (design-led):** Mission/vision anchor, trend analysis, leadership interviews
2. **Distinct Futures:** 3+ different end-state narratives with learning goals
3. **Prototypes:** "Concept car" artifacts to test assumptions
4. **Convergence:** UXR testing to identify winning components  
5. **Roadmap/Testing:** Push promising components into near-term roadmap

## Quick Decision Framework

**Before Starting Any Initiative:**
1. Which strategic pillar does this support?
2. How will we measure success?
3. What assumptions are we testing?
4. What would we stop doing to make room for this?

**If answers aren't clear → Don't start the initiative**

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

❌ **Function-shaped pillars:** "Improve mobile experience"  
✅ **Choice-shaped pillars:** "Enable discovery of advanced features"

❌ **Missing 4th scoring dimension:** Uniqueness of levers  
✅ **Complete scoring:** Impact + Certainty + Clarity + Uniqueness

❌ **Skipping non-goals:** Everything feels like priority  
✅ **Explicit non-goals:** Clear choices about what not to focus on

❌ **No visual concepts:** Strategy document is text-heavy  
✅ **Illustrated strategy:** Design sprint makes pillars tangible

## [Company] Integration

**Traceability:**
- Map pillars → OKR Objective/KR IDs  
- Link to company strategy: `../../01-Company-Context/2-company-strategy.md`
- Monthly newsletter progress updates

**Decision Integration:**
- Use pillar alignment for project approval
- Reference strategy in resource allocation
- Include in quarterly planning context

## Success Indicators

**You've succeeded when:**
- Teams can explain how their work connects to strategic pillars
- Project requests reference pillar alignment  
- Debates shift from "what to build" to "how to build it"
- Leadership stops asking "why are we doing this?"

**Timeline:** 8-12 weeks from kickoff to operationalized strategy

## Time Investment

- **First time:** 8-12 weeks (3-5 weeks preparation, 1 week strategy sprint, 1 week design sprint, 1-2 weeks document writing, 2-3 weeks rollout)
- **Subsequent uses:** 6-8 weeks (can reuse some preparation work, faster execution with experience)
- **Maintenance:** Quarterly reviews (2-4 hours), annual refresh (4-6 weeks)
