# OKR Framework

## Introduction

This framework helps you create and manage Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) that align teams around measurable outcomes. OKRs operationalize strategy into actionable goals that connect daily work to business results.

## Files
- `1-okr-framework.md` — Complete OKR methodology and best practices
- `2-okr-template.md` — Ready-to-use OKR templates and examples
- `3-okr-evaluation.md` — OKR evaluation framework (start with product sense/gut check, then structured evaluation)

## How to Use This Framework

### Step 0: Braindump & Product Sense (Do this first!)

**Before writing OKRs, braindump:**
- What outcomes are you trying to achieve? Dump everything - don't structure yet.
- What does your product sense tell you? What feels like the right outcome?
- What assumptions are you making? List them explicitly.
- What biases might affect your OKRs? (Vanity metrics? Activity vs. outcome?)
- What would great product sense look like here? What would an experienced PM focus on?

**Product sense exercise:**
- If you had to pick ONE outcome that matters most, what would it be? Why?
- What would make you say "these OKRs are obviously wrong"?
- What would make you say "these OKRs are obviously right"?

### Step 1: Review Framework
Read `1-okr-framework.md` to understand OKR principles and process

### Step 2: Use Templates
Start with templates from `2-okr-template.md` to draft your OKRs

### Step 3: Set Objectives
Create 1-2 objectives per team with 2-4 key results each

### Step 4: Track Progress
Use weekly check-ins to update confidence and progress

### Step 5: Evaluate Your OKRs
Use `3-okr-evaluation.md` to evaluate your OKRs:
- **Start with product sense/gut check** (5-10 min): What feels right? What feels off?
- **Then run structured evaluation** to validate and deepen your insights
- Compare your gut feeling to the structured evaluation results

### Step 6: Review Quarterly
Grade results at end of cycle and set next cycle

### Step 7: Self-Reflection
After setting OKRs, reflect:
- How did your thinking evolve from your braindump?
- What biases did you catch? (Vanity metrics? Activity bias?)
- What does your product sense tell you about these OKRs?
- How did your product sense compare to the structured evaluation?
- What would you do differently next time?

## How to Maintain

- **Weekly Reviews**: Update confidence (0/1/2) and track progress against key results
- **Mid-Cycle**: Assess if objectives need adjustment based on learnings
- **End of Cycle**: Grade KRs (0.0-1.0) and document learnings
- **Quarterly**: Archive completed OKRs and set new cycle
