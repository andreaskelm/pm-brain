# OKR Framework

## Introduction

This framework helps you create and manage Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) that align teams around measurable outcomes. OKRs operationalize strategy into actionable goals that connect daily work to business results.

## Files
- `1-okr-framework.md` — Complete OKR methodology and best practices
- `2-okr-template.md` — Ready-to-use OKR templates and examples
- `3-okr-evaluation.md` — OKR evaluation framework (start with product sense/gut check, then structured evaluation)

## Before Using This Framework

⚠️ **Don't jump straight to writing OKRs.**

### 1. Read the Golden Rule

**See:** [`/PRODUCT-SENSE-RULES.md`](../../../../../PRODUCT-SENSE-RULES.md)

### 2. Braindump First (15 min)

**Use prompts from:** [`2-product-sense-prompts.md`](../../../../../2.0-Foundations/2.0.1-Mental-Models/6-Product-Sense-Development/2-product-sense-prompts.md) → "Before a Product Strategy Session" section.

**Quick start (top 3-4 questions):**
- What's actually working? (Be honest)
- What's definitely not working? (Be honest)
- If everything goes right, what does success look like?
- What are we deluding ourselves about?

**See prompts file for full list.** OKRs organize your strategy—they don't create it.

### 3. Then Use This Framework

After your braindump, use OKR templates to structure your goals.

## How to Use This Framework

### Step 1: Review Framework
Read `1-okr-framework.md` to understand OKR principles and process

### Step 2: Use Templates
Start with templates from `2-okr-template.md` to draft your OKRs

### Step 3: Set Objectives
Create 1-2 objectives per team with 2-4 key results each

### Step 4: Track Progress
Use weekly check-ins to update confidence and progress

### Step 5: Quality Checks During Creation
**Quality checks happen automatically during creation** - The agent will scan for common red flags (activity-focused objectives, missing baselines, too many OKRs, etc.) and point them out as you create your OKRs. See "Quick Quality Checks" section in `1-okr-framework.md` for the full list.

**After completing your OKRs**, you can optionally:
- Run a quick quality check: Agent scans for red flags (fast, < 2 min)
- Run full evaluation: Use `3-okr-evaluation.md` for comprehensive peer review, quality gates, or learning

### Step 6: Review Quarterly
Grade results at end of cycle and set next cycle

### Step 7: Self-Reflection
After setting OKRs, reflect:
- How did your thinking evolve from your braindump?
- What biases did you catch? (Vanity metrics? Activity bias?)
- What does your product sense tell you about these OKRs?
- What red flags did the agent catch? What did you catch yourself?
- What would you do differently next time?

## How to Maintain

- **Weekly Reviews**: Update confidence (0/1/2) and track progress against key results
- **Mid-Cycle**: Assess if objectives need adjustment based on learnings
- **End of Cycle**: Grade KRs (0.0-1.0) and document learnings
- **Quarterly**: Archive completed OKRs and set new cycle
