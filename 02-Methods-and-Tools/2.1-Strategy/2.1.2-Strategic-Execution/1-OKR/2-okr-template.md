# OKR Templates

## Introduction

This document provides ready-to-use templates for creating and managing OKRs. Choose the template that fits your needs: Objective Canvas for individual objectives, Team OKRs for team-level planning, or Weekly Check-in for progress tracking.

## How to Use These Templates

1. **Objective Canvas**: Use for individual objective planning and stakeholder communication
2. **Team OKRs**: Use for team-level OKR documentation and tracking
3. **Weekly Check-in**: Use for regular progress updates and confidence tracking

## How to Maintain

- **Weekly**: Use weekly check-in template to track progress
- **Quarterly**: Update team OKRs document with new cycle
- **As Needed**: Update objective canvas when objectives change

# Objective Canvas — Objective [YYYY-QN or Rolling]
- Objective (ID: O#): [clear, outcome-focused, time-bound]
- Why now: [evidence; links to JTBD/Opportunity]
- Business link: [how this ladders to BU/company goals]
- Owner(s): [PM | Eng | Data]
- Stakeholders: [Risk, Ops, Design, Trading, etc.]

## Key Results (2–4)
1) O#-KR1: [metric] baseline → target by [date] (threshold: [pass/fail])
2) O#-KR2: [metric] baseline → target by [date]
3) O#-KR3: [assumption test] [method, threshold, date]
