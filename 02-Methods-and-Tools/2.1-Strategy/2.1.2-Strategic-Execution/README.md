# Strategic Execution

Use these when direction is set and you’re turning it into goals, plans, metrics, and priorities.

## When to use
- You have strategic pillars/choices defined and need to execute.
- You’re planning a quarter/half and need goals, plan, and sequencing.
- You need a measurable north star to track value delivered.
- You must decide what to build first (or what to cut).

## Modules
- **OKR (`1-OKR/`)** — Set objectives/key results that express the strategy in measurable outcomes.
- **Roadmap (`2-Roadmap/`)** — Time-phased plan (e.g., Now/Next/Later) aligned to OKRs and pillars.
- **North Star (`3-North-Star/`)** — Define the north-star metric and supporting metric tree to keep teams aligned.
- **Prioritization (`4-Prioritization/`)** — Methods to choose what to do first: RICE/ICE, MoSCoW, Kano, plus a decision tree.

## Typical flow
1) Start from pillars/choices (see `../2.1.1-Strategic-Foundations/`).
2) Convert to outcomes with **OKRs**.
3) Sequence initiatives with a **Roadmap**.
4) Align on value with a **North Star** metric/tree.
5) Choose what to do first with **Prioritization**.
