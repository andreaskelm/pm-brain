# 2.3 Roadmap Framework

## Introduction

A comprehensive framework for creating stakeholder-friendly product roadmaps that balance transparency with flexibility. Roadmaps communicate strategic direction while maintaining the agility needed for successful product development.

**When to use this framework:**
- Creating quarterly or annual product roadmaps
- Communicating product plans to stakeholders
- Managing expectations around delivery timelines
- Balancing strategic vision with tactical execution

**When roadmaps might not be needed:**
- Very early discovery phases before clear direction emerges
- One-off projects with fixed scope and timeline
- Internal tooling with no external stakeholders

## Files

- **1-roadmap-framework.md** - Complete framework with philosophy, structure, and best practices
- **2-roadmap-template.md** - Ready-to-use template with examples
- **3-roadmap-evaluation.md** - Evaluation framework (start with product sense/gut check, then structured evaluation)

## Before Using This Framework

⚠️ **Don't jump straight to roadmap templates.**

### 1. Read the Golden Rule

**See:** [`/PRODUCT-SENSE-RULES.md`](../../../../../PRODUCT-SENSE-RULES.md)

### 2. Braindump First (15 min)

**Use prompts from:** [`2-product-sense-prompts.md`](../../../../../2.0-Foundations/2.0.1-Mental-Models/6-Product-Sense-Development/2-product-sense-prompts.md) → "Before a Product Strategy Session" and "Before Making a Prioritization Decision" sections.

**Quick start (top 3-4 questions):**
- What's changed in the last 3-6 months that we're not talking about?
- What are we NOT doing if we do this?
- What's the opportunity cost?
- What do I wish we knew that we don't?

**See prompts file for full list.** Roadmaps organize your direction—they don't create it.

### 3. Then Use This Framework

After your braindump, use roadmap templates to communicate your plans.

## How to Use This Framework

### Step 1: Copy Template
Start with `1-roadmap-framework.md` to understand principles, then use `2-roadmap-template.md`

### Step 2: Fill Time Horizons
Add initiatives to NOW, NEXT, and LATER sections based on your braindump

### Step 3: Set Confidence Levels
Use appropriate confidence (🟢🟡🔴) based on certainty

### Step 4: Share with Stakeholders
Use communication guide for different audiences

### Step 5: Schedule Reviews
Set up weekly/monthly/quarterly review cadence

### Step 6: Quality Checks During Creation
**Quality checks happen automatically during creation** - The agent will scan for common red flags (system names instead of problems, binary metrics, vague dependencies, etc.) and point them out as you create your roadmap. See "Quick Quality Checks" section in `1-roadmap-framework.md` for the full list.

**After completing your roadmap**, you can optionally:
- Run a quick quality check: Agent scans for red flags (fast, < 2 min)
- Run full evaluation: Use `3-roadmap-evaluation.md` for comprehensive peer review, quality gates, or learning

### Step 7: Self-Reflection
After creating roadmap, reflect:
- How did your thinking evolve from your braindump?
- What biases did you catch? (Recency? Squeaky wheel? Status quo?)
- What does your product sense tell you about this roadmap?
- What red flags did the agent catch? What did you catch yourself?
- What would you do differently next time?

## How to Maintain

- **Weekly Updates**: Update NOW section with progress and dependency status
- **Monthly Reviews**: Full review of NOW section, adjust confidence levels
- **Quarterly Reviews**: Complete roadmap refresh, move items between time horizons
- **After Major Changes**: Update when strategic priorities or market conditions change

## Key Principles

1. **Roadmaps are not commitments** - They reflect current priorities but adapt to market changes
2. **Confidence-based planning** - Different time horizons require different confidence levels
3. **Outcome-focused** - Emphasize business value over feature delivery
4. **Living document** - Regular updates keep roadmaps relevant and useful
