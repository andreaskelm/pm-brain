# 2.3 Roadmap Framework

## Introduction

A comprehensive framework for creating stakeholder-friendly product roadmaps that balance transparency with flexibility. Roadmaps communicate strategic direction while maintaining the agility needed for successful product development.

**When to use this framework:**
- Creating quarterly or annual product roadmaps
- Communicating product plans to stakeholders
- Managing expectations around delivery timelines
- Balancing strategic vision with tactical execution

**When roadmaps might not be needed:**
- Very early discovery phases before clear direction emerges
- One-off projects with fixed scope and timeline
- Internal tooling with no external stakeholders

## Files

- **1-roadmap-framework.md** - Complete framework with philosophy, structure, and best practices
- **2-roadmap-template.md** - Ready-to-use template with examples
- **3-roadmap-evaluation.md** - Evaluation framework (start with product sense/gut check, then structured evaluation)

## Before Using This Framework

⚠️ **Don't jump straight to roadmap templates.**

### 1. Read the Golden Rule

**See:** [`/PRODUCT-SENSE-RULES.md`](../../../../../PRODUCT-SENSE-RULES.md)

### 2. Braindump First (15 min)

**Use the prompts:** [`02-Methods-and-Tools/2.0-Foundations/2.0.1-Mental-Models/6-Product-Sense-Development/2-product-sense-prompts.md`](../../../../../02-Methods-and-Tools/2.0-Foundations/2.0.1-Mental-Models/6-Product-Sense-Development/2-product-sense-prompts.md)

Specifically, the "Before a Product Strategy Session" and "Before Making a Prioritization Decision" sections:
- What's changed in the last 3-6 months that we're not talking about?
- What are we NOT doing if we do this?
- What's the opportunity cost?
- What do I wish we knew that we don't?

**Roadmaps organize your direction—they don't create it.**

### 3. Then Use This Framework

After your braindump, use roadmap templates to communicate your plans.

## How to Use This Framework

### Step 1: Copy Template
Start with `1-roadmap-framework.md` to understand principles, then use `2-roadmap-template.md`

### Step 2: Fill Time Horizons
Add initiatives to NOW, NEXT, and LATER sections based on your braindump

### Step 3: Set Confidence Levels
Use appropriate confidence (🟢🟡🔴) based on certainty

### Step 4: Share with Stakeholders
Use communication guide for different audiences

### Step 5: Schedule Reviews
Set up weekly/monthly/quarterly review cadence

### Step 6: Evaluate Your Roadmap
Use `3-roadmap-evaluation.md` to evaluate your roadmap:
- **Start with product sense/gut check** (5-10 min): What feels right? What feels off?
- **Then run structured evaluation** to validate and deepen your insights
- Compare your gut feeling to the structured evaluation results

### Step 7: Self-Reflection
After creating roadmap, reflect:
- How did your thinking evolve from your braindump?
- What biases did you catch? (Recency? Squeaky wheel? Status quo?)
- What does your product sense tell you about this roadmap?
- How did your product sense compare to the structured evaluation?
- What would you do differently next time?

## How to Maintain

- **Weekly Updates**: Update NOW section with progress and dependency status
- **Monthly Reviews**: Full review of NOW section, adjust confidence levels
- **Quarterly Reviews**: Complete roadmap refresh, move items between time horizons
- **After Major Changes**: Update when strategic priorities or market conditions change

## Key Principles

1. **Roadmaps are not commitments** - They reflect current priorities but adapt to market changes
2. **Confidence-based planning** - Different time horizons require different confidence levels
3. **Outcome-focused** - Emphasize business value over feature delivery
4. **Living document** - Regular updates keep roadmaps relevant and useful
