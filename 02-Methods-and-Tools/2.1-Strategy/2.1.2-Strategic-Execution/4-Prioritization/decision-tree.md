# Prioritization Decision Guide

Pick the method that fits your context:

- **Need a quick call / little data? → ICE**  
  - Fast triage, growth tests, early ideas.

- **Bigger bets with data? → RICE**  
  - Feature/initiative scoring when you have estimates for Reach/Impact/Confidence/Effort.

- **Workshop / alignment / visual? → Impact–Effort (Value–Effort)**  
  - Stakeholder workshops, brainstorming sessions, first-pass sequencing.

- **Scope negotiation / timeboxed release? → MoSCoW**  
  - MVP definition, “what makes the cut,” stakeholder expectation setting.

- **Balance hygiene vs. delight? → Kano**  
  - Ensure table stakes are covered while keeping room for delighters.

Tips:
- If time-boxed: start with MoSCoW, then sanity-check top items with ICE or RICE.
- If data-light but many items: begin with ICE, then re-score top items with RICE.
- If there’s disagreement: run an Impact–Effort workshop to surface assumptions, then decide.
- If you risk over-indexing on delighters: run Kano first, then prioritize with RICE/ICE.
