# Kano Model Framework

## Introduction

This framework helps product teams classify features by their impact on customer satisfaction. The Kano Model categorizes features into Basic Needs, Performance Needs, and Delight Needs, helping teams understand what customers expect vs. what will surprise them.

## How to Use This Framework

### Step 0: Braindump & Product Sense (Do this first!)

**Use prompts from:** [2-product-sense-prompts.md](../../../../../2.0-Foundations/2.0.1-Mental-Models/6-Product-Sense-Development/2-product-sense-prompts.md) → [Before Making a Prioritization Decision](../../../../../2.0-Foundations/2.0.1-Mental-Models/6-Product-Sense-Development/2-product-sense-prompts.md#before-making-a-prioritization-decision).

**Quick start:** What features are you considering? Which feel like table stakes vs. game-changers? What assumptions about customer expectations? What biases might affect your categorization? **See prompts file for full list.**

**Product sense exercise:**
- If you could only ship features that prevent dissatisfaction, which would they be? (These are likely must-haves)
- Which features would make customers choose you over competitors? (These might be performance or delighters)
- Which features would customers not even know to ask for? (These could be delighters)
- What would make you say "this categorization is obviously wrong"?

### Step 1: Review Framework
Read `1-kano-framework.md` to understand Kano Model principles, categories, and process

### Step 2: Use Template
Start with templates from `2-kano-template.md` to classify your features

### Step 3: Design Questionnaire
Create functional and dysfunctional question pairs for each feature using the standard Kano format

### Step 4: Survey Customers
Distribute survey to target customers (minimum 20-30 responses per feature, ideal 100+)

### Step 5: Analyze Results
Categorize features using Kano Evaluation Table and calculate satisfaction coefficients (CS+/CS-)

### Step 6: Apply to Prioritization
Use categories to inform roadmap: must-haves first, then performance features, then strategic delighters

### Step 7: Self-Reflection
After classifying features with Kano, reflect:
- How did your thinking evolve from your braindump?
- What biases did you catch? (Status quo? Competitive copying? Squeaky wheel?)
- What does your product sense tell you about these categorizations?
- Did any features surprise you with their category?
- What would you classify differently next time?

## When to Use

- **Feature prioritization** when building product roadmap
- **MVP definition** to identify true must-haves vs. nice-to-haves
- **Competitive analysis** to understand where to differentiate
- **Customer research** to uncover unspoken expectations and delight opportunities
- **Stakeholder alignment** to justify feature decisions with data
- **Product strategy** to balance basics, performance, and delighters
- **Resource allocation** to invest appropriately across feature types

## When Kano May Not Be Ideal

- Very early discovery before features are even conceptualized
- B2B with few customers where survey sample size is too small
- Technical prioritization where customer perception isn't primary driver
- When you need objective scoring across many similar features (use RICE instead)
- Real-time tactical decisions - Kano requires survey time
- When categories are obvious - may be overkill for simple products

## Key Principles

- **Customer satisfaction is emotional, not linear** - Different features impact satisfaction differently
- **Invest appropriately in basics** - Must-haves need to be "good enough," not over-engineered
- **Choose delighters strategically** - Select 1-3 attractive features that align with brand
- **Monitor category evolution** - Features drift from attractive → performance → must-have over time
- **Segment your analysis** - Different customer segments have different needs

## How to Maintain

- **After Survey**: Validate top insights with qualitative research
- **Monthly**: Monitor feature adoption and satisfaction for launched features
- **Quarterly**: Quick pulse check on category stability
- **Annually**: Full Kano re-survey to track category evolution
- **After Major Changes**: Re-survey when entering new markets or after competitor launches
