# Impact–Effort (Value–Effort) One-Pager

Use when you need a fast, visual alignment tool for sequencing work.

## When to use
- Workshops with stakeholders; you need a shared picture.
- Early pass before deeper scoring (e.g., before RICE).
- You have low/medium data quality but must decide soon.

## How to run (30–45 min)
1) **List items**: Bring the backlog slice you’re deciding on.
2) **Define axes**: Impact (value) on Y, Effort (cost) on X.
3) **Place items**: Quickly place each item as a group; timebox discussion.
4) **Label quadrants**:
   - High Impact / Low Effort → Quick wins
   - High Impact / High Effort → Big bets
   - Low Impact / Low Effort → Fill-ins
   - Low Impact / High Effort → Avoid / Defer
5) **Decide next steps**: What moves to Now/Next/Later? What to cut?
6) **Capture assumptions**: Note why items landed where; revisit if new data arrives.

## Variations
- **Value–Complexity**: Use perceived complexity instead of effort when estimates are fuzzy.
- **Risk overlay**: Add color dots for confidence/risk; revisit red items with better data.

## Follow-ups
- Re-score top items with **ICE** or **RICE** for more rigor.
- Document final placement and rationale; set a **revisit date**.
