# Prioritization

Systematic methods to decide what to do first. Use these to make defensible, transparent calls that align to strategy.

## Before Using This Framework

⚠️ **Don't jump straight to scoring frameworks.**

### 1. Read the Golden Rule

**See:** [`/PRODUCT-SENSE-RULES.md`](../../../../../PRODUCT-SENSE-RULES.md)

### 2. Braindump First (15 min)

**Use the prompts:** [`02-Methods-and-Tools/2.0-Foundations/2.0.1-Mental-Models/6-Product-Sense-Development/2-product-sense-prompts.md`](../../../../../02-Methods-and-Tools/2.0-Foundations/2.0.1-Mental-Models/6-Product-Sense-Development/2-product-sense-prompts.md)

Specifically, the "Before Making a Prioritization Decision" section:
- What evidence do I have this matters? (Real data, not vibes)
- What's the opportunity cost?
- Am I falling in love with my solution vs. the problem?
- What would make me 10x more confident?

**Prioritization frameworks can't create judgment—they organize it.**

### 3. Log the Decision (Optional but Recommended)

Before or after you score, capture the decision in your **prioritization decision log**:

- **Log file:** `00-Meta/prioritization-decision-log.md`
- **What to capture:** who this is for, the real job/pain, evidence, opportunity cost, and “what could catastrophically go wrong if we’re wrong?”

This gives you a reusable trail of **why** you prioritized what you did, and lets you revisit the quality of your calls later.

### 4. Then Use This Framework

After your braindump (and optional log entry), use prioritization methods to structure your decision.

  - `1-RICE-ICE-scoring-framework.md`
  - `2-RICE-ICE-scoring-template.md`
- `2-Value-Effort-Matrix/2-Impact-Effort.md` — Lightweight Impact–Effort (Value–Effort) workshop method for visual alignment
- `3-MoSCoW/` — Categorical prioritization for scope/timeboxing
- `4-Kano-Model/` — Balance hygiene vs. delight
- `decision-tree.md` — Which method should I use? (quick chooser)

## How to use
1) **Braindump & product sense** – capture initiatives, assumptions, and biases first.  
2) **Pick a method** – use `decision-tree.md` to choose (RICE/ICE, Impact-Effort, MoSCoW, Kano).  
3) **Apply the framework** – use the relevant framework/template pair.  
4) **Review balance** – check mix of quick wins vs. big bets; hygiene vs. delight.  
5) **Decide & document** – record rationale and next review date.  
6) **Reflect** – what changed, what biases you caught, what you’d do differently.

## When to use
- Backlog or quarterly planning
- Sequencing roadmap items (Now/Next/Later)
- MVP scoping or release negotiation (MoSCoW)
- Balancing delighters vs. table stakes (Kano)
- Workshop alignment (Impact-Effort)

## How to maintain
- **Weekly**: Revisit top items for progress/changes.  
- **Bi-weekly**: Groom backlog, score new ideas.  
- **Monthly**: Portfolio balance check.  
- **Quarterly**: Full re-prioritization aligned to strategy/OKRs.
