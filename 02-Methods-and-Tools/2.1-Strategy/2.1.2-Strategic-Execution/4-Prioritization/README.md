# Prioritization

Systematic methods to decide what to do first. Use these to make defensible, transparent calls that align to strategy.

- `2-Value-Effort-Matrix/2-Impact-Effort.md` — Lightweight Impact–Effort (Value–Effort) workshop method for visual alignment
- `3-MoSCoW/` — Categorical prioritization for scope/timeboxing
- `4-Kano-Model/` — Balance hygiene vs. delight
- `decision-tree.md` — Which method should I use? (quick chooser)

## How to use
1) **Braindump & product sense** – capture initiatives, assumptions, and biases first.  
2) **Pick a method** – use `decision-tree.md` to choose (RICE/ICE, Impact-Effort, MoSCoW, Kano).  
3) **Apply the framework** – use the relevant framework/template pair.  
4) **Review balance** – check mix of quick wins vs. big bets; hygiene vs. delight.  
5) **Decide & document** – record rationale and next review date.  
6) **Reflect** – what changed, what biases you caught, what you’d do differently.

## When to use
- Backlog or quarterly planning
- Sequencing roadmap items (Now/Next/Later)
- MVP scoping or release negotiation (MoSCoW)
- Balancing delighters vs. table stakes (Kano)
- Workshop alignment (Impact-Effort)

## How to maintain
- **Weekly**: Revisit top items for progress/changes.  
- **Bi-weekly**: Groom backlog, score new ideas.  
- **Monthly**: Portfolio balance check.  
- **Quarterly**: Full re-prioritization aligned to strategy/OKRs.
