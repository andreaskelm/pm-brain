# MoSCoW Prioritization Framework

## Introduction

This framework helps product teams prioritize features by categorizing them into Must Have, Should Have, Could Have, and Won't Have. MoSCoW is particularly useful for MVP scoping, time-boxed releases, and stakeholder negotiations where clear boundaries are needed.

## How to Use This Framework

### Step 0: Braindump & Product Sense (Do this first!)

**Before using MoSCoW, braindump:**
- What features/initiatives are you considering? List everything - don't categorize yet.
- What does your product sense tell you? What truly makes or breaks this release?
- What assumptions are you making about must-haves? Are they actually must-haves?
- What biases might affect your categorization? (Stakeholder pressure? Latest customer complaint? Personal preferences?)
- What would great product sense look like here? What would an experienced PM absolutely insist on vs. be flexible about?

**Product sense exercise:**
- If you could ONLY ship 3 things, what would they be? Why?
- What would make you cancel this release entirely? (These are your true must-haves)
- What would be "nice to ship but we'd still succeed without"?
- What are you tempted to call a must-have that really isn't?

### Step 1: Review Framework
Read `1-moscow-prioritization-framework.md` to understand MoSCoW principles, categories, and process

### Step 2: Use Template
Start with templates from `2-moscow-prioritization-template.md` to categorize your initiatives

### Step 3: Conduct Prioritization Session
Facilitate collaborative categorization with stakeholders using the framework guidelines

### Step 4: Validate Distribution
Ensure must-haves are ≤60% of effort, with ~20% should-haves and ~20% could-haves for flexibility

### Step 5: Document and Communicate
Use the template to document decisions and communicate priorities clearly to all stakeholders

### Step 6: Review Regularly
Revisit categorization as you learn more and as scope changes

### Step 7: Self-Reflection
After prioritizing with MoSCoW, reflect:
- How did your thinking evolve from your braindump?
- What biases did you catch? (Stakeholder pressure? Recency bias? Personal preferences?)
- What does your product sense tell you about these priorities?
- Did the "cancel release" test help you be more ruthless?
- What would you categorize differently next time?

## When to Use

- **MVP scoping** - Define minimum viable feature set
- **Time-boxed releases** - Fixed deadline projects requiring clear boundaries
- **Sprint planning** - Prioritize backlog items for upcoming sprints
- **Stakeholder negotiations** - Manage competing demands with clear categorization
- **Managing scope creep** - Explicitly define what's out of scope (Won't Have)

## When MoSCoW May Not Be Ideal

- Early discovery before direction is clear
- Continuous delivery without release boundaries
- Single-feature projects too simple to need categorization
- Complex dependencies requiring more sophisticated sequencing
- When you need objective scoring across many similar items (use RICE instead)

## Key Principles

- **Must-haves should pass the "cancel release" test** - Be ruthless
- **Limit must-haves to ≤60% of effort** - Prevents overload
- **Maintain 20% could-have contingency** - Provides flexibility
- **Document won't-haves explicitly** - Manages expectations
- **Review and adjust regularly** - Stay flexible

## How to Maintain

- **Weekly Reviews**: Progress on must-haves, dependency status
- **Bi-weekly Reviews**: Review should-haves, adjust could-haves based on capacity
- **Monthly Reviews**: Full MoSCoW review, effort distribution check
- **Ad-hoc Reviews**: When scope changes, new requirements emerge, or major blockers hit
