# North Star Framework

## Introduction

This framework helps product teams align around a single metric that captures customer value and drives sustainable growth. The North Star Framework is NOT a project plan or feature list—it's a strategic alignment tool.

## Files
- `1-north-star-framework.md` — Complete North Star methodology and best practices
- `2-north-star-template.md` — Ready-to-use North Star template with examples
- `3-north-star-evaluation.md` — Evaluation framework (start with product sense/gut check, then structured evaluation)

## How to Use This Framework

### Step 0: Braindump & Product Sense (Do this first!)

⚠️ **Don't jump straight to templates.**

**Braindump first:** See [`PRODUCT-SENSE-RULES.md`](../../../../../PRODUCT-SENSE-RULES.md) for the golden rule and workflow.

**Use prompts from:** [`2-product-sense-prompts.md`](../../../../../2.0-Foundations/2.0.1-Mental-Models/6-Product-Sense-Development/2-product-sense-prompts.md) → "Before a Product Strategy Session" section.

**Quick start (top 3-4 questions):**
- What outcomes are you trying to achieve? Dump everything - don't structure yet.
- What does your product sense tell you? What metric feels like it captures real value?
- What assumptions are you making? List them explicitly.
- What biases might affect your metric choice? (See Foundations: `../../2.0-Foundations/README.md` (Bias Framework) for bias awareness)

**See prompts file for full list.**

### Step 1: Review Framework
Read `1-north-star-framework.md` to understand North Star principles and process

### Step 2: Use Template
Start with templates from `2-north-star-template.md` to draft your North Star

### Step 3: Define North Star Metric
Create a single metric that captures customer value and predicts business outcomes

### Step 4: Identify Input Metrics
Define 3-5 input metrics that teams can directly influence

### Step 5: Map Work Connections
Connect current initiatives to input metrics

### Step 6: Quality Checks During Creation
**Quality checks happen automatically during creation** - The agent will scan for common red flags (vanity metrics, unclear input/output relationships, not actionable, etc.) and point them out as you create your North Star framework. See "Quick Quality Checks" section in `1-north-star-framework.md` for the full list.

**After completing your North Star framework**, you can optionally:
- Run a quick quality check: Agent scans for red flags (fast, < 2 min)
- Run full evaluation: Use `3-north-star-evaluation.md` for comprehensive peer review, quality gates, or learning

### Step 7: Review Regularly
Use weekly/monthly/quarterly review cadence to maintain alignment

### Step 8: Self-Reflection
After defining your North Star, reflect:
- How did your thinking evolve from your braindump?
- What biases did you catch? (Vanity metrics? Activity bias?)
- What does your product sense tell you about this metric?
- What red flags did the agent catch? What did you catch yourself?
- How well does this connect daily work to customer value?

## When to Use

- Setting strategic direction for a product
- Need to align cross-functional teams around a single goal
- Want to connect daily work to business outcomes
- Establishing measurement framework for product success

## How to Maintain

- **Weekly Check-ins**: Review input metrics and progress
- **Monthly Reviews**: Full metric review including North Star
- **Quarterly Deep-Dives**: Validate framework, adjust if needed
- **Annual Reviews**: Major strategy alignment check
