# North Star Framework

## Introduction

This framework helps product teams align around a single metric that captures customer value and drives sustainable growth. The North Star Framework is NOT a project plan or feature list—it's a strategic alignment tool.

## How to Use This Framework

### Step 0: Braindump & Product Sense (Do this first!)

**Before defining your North Star, braindump:**
- What outcomes are you trying to achieve? Dump everything - don't structure yet.
- What does your product sense tell you? What metric feels like it captures real value?
- What assumptions are you making? List them explicitly.
- What biases might affect your metric choice? (Vanity metrics? Activity vs. outcome?)
- What would great product sense look like here? What would an experienced PM focus on?

**Product sense exercise:**
- If you had to pick ONE metric that represents customer value, what would it be? Why?
- What would make you say "this North Star is obviously wrong"?
- What would make you say "this North Star is obviously right"?

### Step 1: Review Framework
Read `1-north-star-framework.md` to understand North Star principles and process

### Step 2: Use Template
Start with templates from `2-north-star-template.md` to draft your North Star

### Step 3: Define North Star Metric
Create a single metric that captures customer value and predicts business outcomes

### Step 4: Identify Input Metrics
Define 3-5 input metrics that teams can directly influence

### Step 5: Map Work Connections
Connect current initiatives to input metrics

### Step 6: Review Regularly
Use weekly/monthly/quarterly review cadence to maintain alignment

### Step 7: Self-Reflection
After defining your North Star, reflect:
- How did your thinking evolve from your braindump?
- What biases did you catch? (Vanity metrics? Activity bias?)
- What does your product sense tell you about this metric?
- How well does this connect daily work to customer value?

## When to Use

- Setting strategic direction for a product
- Need to align cross-functional teams around a single goal
- Want to connect daily work to business outcomes
- Establishing measurement framework for product success

## How to Maintain

- **Weekly Check-ins**: Review input metrics and progress
- **Monthly Reviews**: Full metric review including North Star
- **Quarterly Deep-Dives**: Validate framework, adjust if needed
- **Annual Reviews**: Major strategy alignment check
