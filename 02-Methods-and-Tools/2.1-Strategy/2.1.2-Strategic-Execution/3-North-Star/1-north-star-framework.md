# North Star Framework

## Overview

This framework helps product teams align around a single metric that captures customer value and drives sustainable growth. The North Star Framework is NOT a project plan or feature list—it's a strategic alignment tool.

## Step 0: Braindump & Product Sense (Do this first!)

**Use prompts from:** [2-product-sense-prompts.md](../../../../../2.0-Foundations/2.0.1-Mental-Models/6-Product-Sense-Development/2-product-sense-prompts.md) → [Before a Product Strategy Session](../../../../../2.0-Foundations/2.0.1-Mental-Models/6-Product-Sense-Development/2-product-sense-prompts.md#before-a-product-strategy-session). Quick start: What outcomes are you trying to achieve? What metric feels like it captures real value? What assumptions? What biases might affect your metric choice? **See prompts file for full list.**

**Product sense exercise:**
- If you had to pick ONE metric that represents customer value, what would it be? Why?
- What would make you say "this North Star is obviously wrong"?
- What would make you say "this North Star is obviously right"?

## Core Philosophy

### The North Star Framework is NOT a Silver Bullet

A North Star Framework is a living document that should:

- **Enable customer-centricity over vanity metrics** - Focus on value delivered, not just activity
- **Drive cross-functional alignment** - Everyone understands how their work connects to growth
- **Encourage strategic focus** - Teams prioritize work that moves the metric
- **Reduce organizational friction** - Clear metrics prevent endless debates

### Three Types of Product “Games”

Choose the game your product is playing:

- **ATTENTION** - Users return frequently (social media, content platforms)
- **TRANSACTION** - Users complete purchases (e-commerce, marketplaces)
- **PRODUCTIVITY** - Users accomplish tasks efficiently (SaaS, tools)

## Framework Structure

### 1. Header Section

Always include:

- **Disclaimer** - “This North Star reflects our current strategy and may evolve”
- **Product game** - Which game are you playing?
- **Last updated date**
- **Next review date**

### 2. North Star Metric (The “What”)

**Use when:**

- You can measure it consistently
- It represents customer value delivered
- It connects to business outcomes
- Teams can explain how their work impacts it

**Structure:**

- Metric name (customer-value focused)
- Definition (precise and measurable)
- Why this metric (connects value to growth)
- Current baseline

### 3. Input Metrics (The “How”)

**Use when:**

- Teams can directly influence them
- They’re leading indicators of the North Star
- You have 3-5 key inputs (not more)
- Each maps to team capabilities

**Structure:**

- Input name (action-oriented)
- How it influences North Star
- Owning team
- Current value and target

### 4. Work Connections (The “Execution”)

**Use when:**

- Initiatives clearly move an input
- You can define success criteria
- Teams need prioritization clarity

**Structure:**

- Initiative or bet
- Which input it moves
- Expected impact
- How you’ll measure success

## How to Use This Framework

### Step 1: Identify Your Product Game

**Purpose:** Determine which type of product game you're playing

**Activities:**

- Rationale documented

**Time estimate:** 30 minutes - 1 hour

### Step 2: Brainstorm North Star Candidates

**Purpose:** Generate potential North Star metrics

**Activities:**

## Stakeholder Communication

### For Leadership

- Focus on North Star and business correlation
- Highlight strategic bets and trade-offs
- Show how inputs drive sustainable growth

### For Product Teams

- Emphasize inputs they can directly influence
- Connect daily work to North Star movement
- Celebrate wins and share learnings

### For Cross-Functional Teams

- Show how their function contributes
- Provide clear success criteria
- Explain interdependencies

### For Individual Contributors

- Make the connection personal: “My work → Input → North Star → Customer value”
- Share impact stories regularly
- Create feedback loops

## Common Challenges and Solutions

### “This metric doesn’t capture everything we do”

**Response pattern:**
“You’re right—no single metric can. That’s why we have inputs that break down how we deliver value. What aspect of customer value do you think we’re missing?”

### “Can’t we just track everything?”

**Response pattern:**
“Tracking everything means focusing on nothing. Our North Star and inputs help us make trade-offs. What decision are you trying to make that requires additional metrics?”

### “My work doesn’t impact the North Star”

**Response pattern:**
“Let’s map it together. What outcome does your work enable? How does that connect to one of our inputs? If we can’t draw the connection, we should discuss priorities.”

### “The metric isn’t moving despite our efforts”

**Response pattern:**
“Let’s examine our beliefs. Do our inputs actually drive the North Star? Are we measuring the right things? This is exactly when the framework helps us learn and adapt.”

## Best Practices

### Do’s

- Start with customer value, not business goals
- Keep inputs between 3-5 (focus matters)
- Revisit and refine regularly
- Celebrate input movement, not just North Star
- Use workshops for definition and alignment
- Tell stories of how work connects to impact

### Don’ts

- Don’t choose vanity metrics as your North Star
- Don’t create North Stars for every team (one product = one North Star)
- Don’t set and forget—it requires cultivation
- Don’t skip the input metrics (they’re how teams act)
- Don’t ignore qualitative insights
- Don’t expect perfection on day one

## Metrics for Framework Success

Track these to know if your framework is working:

- **Alignment** - Can everyone explain the North Star and their contribution?
- **Prioritization clarity** - Fewer debates about “what to work on next”
- **Strategic decisions** - Features evaluated against North Star impact
- **Team autonomy** - Teams make better local decisions
- **Learning velocity** - Faster insight to action cycles

### Anti-Workshop: Bad North Star Exercise

Spend 10 minutes brainstorming what a TERRIBLE North Star would be for your company. This frees thinking and sets guardrails:

- What metrics would make us feel good but deliver no value?
- What could we optimize that would hurt customers?
- What's easy to measure but meaningless?

## Advanced Techniques

### Composite North Star Metrics

**When to use:** When a single metric doesn't capture value adequately

**How it works:**
- Combine multiple metrics into composite score
- Weight metrics by importance
- Normalize metrics to same scale
- Calculate composite North Star

**Example:**
```
North Star = (0.4 × Weekly Active Users) + (0.3 × Engagement Score) + (0.3 × Revenue per User)
Result: Single metric that captures multiple dimensions of value
```

### Segmented North Stars

**When to use:** When different customer segments have different value drivers

**How it works:**
- Define North Star for each major segment
- Track segment-specific North Stars
- Aggregate to overall North Star
- Use for segment-specific prioritization

**Example:**
```
Enterprise North Star: "Weekly active enterprise teams"
SMB North Star: "Monthly active SMB teams"
Overall: Weighted average based on segment size
```

### Dynamic Input Metrics

**When to use:** When input metrics need to evolve as product matures

**How it works:**
- Start with initial set of input metrics
- Review and adjust quarterly
- Add new inputs as product evolves
- Remove inputs that no longer drive North Star

**Example:**
```
Q1: Inputs = Acquisition, Activation, Engagement
Q2: Add Retention (product matured)
Q3: Add Expansion (new capability)
Result: Inputs evolve with product maturity
```

### North Star with Guardrails

**When to use:** When optimizing North Star could harm other important metrics

**How it works:**
- Define North Star metric
- Set guardrail metrics (must not degrade)
- Monitor both North Star and guardrails
- Adjust if guardrails are at risk

**Example:**
```
North Star: "Weekly active users"
Guardrails: 
  - Customer satisfaction (must stay >4.0/5.0)
  - Revenue per user (must not decrease)
  - Churn rate (must stay <5%)
Result: Optimize North Star while protecting other metrics
```

### Predictive North Star Modeling

**When to use:** When you want to predict North Star movement

**How it works:**
- Build model predicting North Star from inputs
- Identify which inputs have strongest predictive power
- Use model to prioritize input improvements
- Validate predictions against actual results

**Example:**
```
Model: North Star = f(Input1, Input2, Input3)
Insight: Input2 has 2x predictive power of Input1
Action: Prioritize initiatives that move Input2
Result: More effective prioritization
```
