## 🧭 How to Read This Framework

### North Star Metric

This single metric represents the value we deliver to customers. When it goes up, customers get more value, and our business grows sustainably.

### Input Metrics

These are the levers we can pull to move the North Star. Each input should be:

- Directly influenced by team work
- A leading indicator of the North Star
- Measurable and trackable

### Work Connections

These are our current bets on how to move the inputs. Each initiative should clearly state which input it impacts and how we’ll measure success.

### North Star Metric Names (Customer-value oriented)

✅ **Good:**

- “Weekly Learning Users” (Amplitude)
- “Nights booked” (Airbnb)
- “Messages sent per week” (Slack)
- “Items received on time monthly” (Delivery service)

❌ **Bad:**

- “Total registered users”

❌ **Bad:**

- “Engagement”
- “Stickiness”

- “Quality”

### Connection Descriptions (Clear causation)

✅ **Good:**

## When to Change Your North Star

Consider changing your North Star Metric if:

✓ Your product strategy has fundamentally shifted
✓ You’ve pivoted to serve a different customer segment
✓ The metric no longer predicts business outcomes
✓ The market has changed dramatically
✓ You’ve outgrown your current metric (too easy/saturated)

**Don’t change your North Star if:**
✗ The metric isn’t moving fast enough (this is a signal to learn)
✗ You’re not hitting targets (fix execution, not the metric)
✗ Leadership wants different numbers (address underlying strategy misalignment)
✗ A competitor uses a different metric (your strategy should be unique)
