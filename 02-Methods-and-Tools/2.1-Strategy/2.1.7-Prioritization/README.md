# Prioritization Framework

## Introduction

This framework helps product teams make systematic decisions about what to build next. Prioritization is NOT about pleasing everyone—it's about maximizing value delivery with limited resources.

- `2-prioritization-template.md` — Ready-to-use prioritization templates and scoring worksheets

## How to Use This Framework

### Step 0: Braindump & Product Sense (Do this first!)

**Before prioritizing, braindump:**
- What initiatives are you considering? Dump everything - don't filter yet.
- What does your product sense tell you? What feels urgent vs. important?
- What assumptions are you making about value and effort? List them.
- What biases might affect your prioritization? (Recency bias? HiPPO? Squeaky wheel?)
- What would great product sense look like here? What would an experienced PM prioritize?

**Product sense exercise:**
- If you had to ship ONE thing next, what would it be? Why?
- What would make you say "this prioritization is obviously wrong"?
- What would make you say "this prioritization is obviously right"?

### Step 1: Review Framework
Read `1-prioritization-framework.md` to understand prioritization methods and when to use each

### Step 2: Choose Your Method
Select RICE, ICE, Effort-Impact, or Value-Complexity based on your context. For categorical prioritization (Must/Should/Could/Won't), see MoSCoW Prioritization: `../2.1.8-MoSCoW-Prioritization/README.md`

### Step 3: Use Template
Start with templates from `2-prioritization-template.md` to score and rank initiatives

### Step 4: Score Initiatives
Collaboratively score all initiatives using your chosen method

### Step 5: Review Portfolio Balance
Ensure you have the right mix of quick wins, major projects, and strategic bets

### Step 6: Make Decisions
Prioritize top items and document deprioritization rationale

### Step 7: Self-Reflection
After prioritizing, reflect:
- How did your thinking evolve from your braindump?
- What biases did you catch? (Recency? HiPPO? Squeaky wheel?)
- What does your product sense tell you about these priorities?
- How well do these priorities align with strategy?

## When to Use

- Backlog prioritization
- Quarterly planning
- Feature prioritization
- Resource allocation decisions
- Evaluating new opportunities

## How to Maintain

- **Weekly Check-ins**: Review progress on prioritized work
- **Bi-weekly Backlog Grooming**: Score new ideas, re-evaluate existing
- **Monthly Strategic Review**: Portfolio balance check
- **Quarterly Planning**: Full re-prioritization aligned with strategy
