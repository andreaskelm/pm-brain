# 2.1 – Strategy Methods Overview

This domain contains the core strategy methods you use to set direction, translate it into plans, and specify work.

## Before Using Any Strategy Framework

⚠️ **Don't jump straight to strategy templates.**

### 1. Read the Golden Rule

**See:** [PRODUCT-SENSE-RULES.md](../../PRODUCT-SENSE-RULES.md) (repo root)

### 2. Braindump First (20-30 min)

**Use the prompts:** [2-product-sense-prompts.md](../2.0-Foundations/2.0.1-Mental-Models/6-Product-Sense-Development/2-product-sense-prompts.md) — "Before a Product Strategy Session" section.  
**Or start from the entry point:** [0-start-here-product-thinking.md](../2.0-Foundations/2.0.1-Mental-Models/6-Product-Sense-Development/0-start-here-product-thinking.md) (simple prompt for a product-thinking chat).

Specifically, the "Before a Product Strategy Session" section:
- What's actually working? (Be honest)
- What's definitely not working? (Be honest)
- What are we uniquely positioned to do?
- What are we deluding ourselves about?

**Strategy frameworks organize direction—they don't create vision.**

### 3. Then Use Strategy Frameworks

After your braindump, use the frameworks below to structure your strategy.

---

## Strategic Frameworks

## How this is organized

- **Strategic Foundations** (`2.1.1-Strategic-Foundations/`)  
  Long-term direction: Strategy Blocks (process), Playing to Win (choices), Good Strategy/Bad Strategy (evaluation), plus `when-to-use-which.md` as the decision guide.

- **Strategic Execution** (`2.1.2-Strategic-Execution/`)  
  Turning direction into action: OKRs (goals), Roadmap (time-phased plan), North Star (measurement), Prioritization (what to do first, with RICE/ICE, MoSCoW, Kano, decision tree).

## Typical flow

Strategic Foundations → OKRs → Roadmap → North Star → Prioritization → (PRDs/Personas/Delivery)
