# 2.1 – Strategy Methods Overview

This domain contains the core strategy methods you use to set direction, translate it into plans, and specify work.

**Before using any strategy framework:**
1. **Braindump first** – Dump your thoughts, concerns, and ideas about the strategic challenge
2. **Use your product sense** – What does your gut tell you? What feels right or wrong?
3. **Think critically** – Challenge your assumptions. What biases might be affecting your view?
4. **Reflect** – After using frameworks, reflect on what you learned and how your thinking evolved

## How this is organized

- **Strategic Foundations** (`2.1.1-Strategic-Foundations/`)  
  Long-term direction: Strategy Blocks (process), Playing to Win (choices), Good Strategy/Bad Strategy (evaluation), plus `when-to-use-which.md` as the decision guide.

- **Strategic Execution** (`2.1.2-Strategic-Execution/`)  
  Turning direction into action: OKRs (goals), Roadmap (time-phased plan), North Star (measurement), Prioritization (what to do first, with RICE/ICE, MoSCoW, Kano, decision tree).

## Typical flow

Strategic Foundations → OKRs → Roadmap → North Star → Prioritization → (PRDs/Personas/Delivery)
