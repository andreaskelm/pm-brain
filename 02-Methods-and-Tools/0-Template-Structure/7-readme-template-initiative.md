# 4.x – [Initiative Codename]

> Replace `[Initiative Codename]` and `4.x` with your initiative code. Remove this instruction block when done.

This folder captures early thinking, research links, and execution docs for this initiative. Copy this structure (or create a new `4.x-[initiative-name]/` folder) and replace placeholders with real content.

## How to use this folder
- Create this folder when an idea is past “gut feel” and needs structured exploration.
- Link research artifacts from `03-Research-Artifacts/`.
- Keep docs lightweight; update as you learn.

## Suggested files (and when to use them)
- `opportunity-assessment.md` — Early thinking, hypotheses, assumptions. **Use when:** framing the opportunity. (Template: `02-Methods-and-Tools/2.2-Discovery/2.2.4-Opportunity-Assessment/2-opportunity-assessment-template.md`)
- `summary.md` — Exec one-pager once more concrete. **Use when:** aligning stakeholders quickly.
- `prd.md` — Product requirements. **Use when:** ready to specify and build. (Templates in `02-Methods-and-Tools/2.3-Execution/2.3.4-PRD/`)
- `roadmap.md` — Milestones/phases/timelines. **Use when:** sequencing work. (Templates in `02-Methods-and-Tools/2.1-Strategy/2.1.2-Strategic-Execution/2-Roadmap/`)
- `decisions.md` — Decision log (what/why/who/when). **Use when:** any material decision is made.
- `risks.md` — Key risks and mitigations. **Use when:** risk profile changes.
- `research/` — Links to artifacts in `03-Research-Artifacts/` (interviews, synthesis, experiments).
- `stakeholders/` — Stakeholder map and communication plan. **Use when:** mapping influence and communication rhythm.
- `metrics/` — Initiative-level metrics and dashboard links. **Use when:** defining success and tracking it.

## Initiative lifecycle (suggested flow)
```
Opportunity Assessment → Discovery (research/interviews) → Problem/Solution framing → Validation → PRD → Roadmap → Build/Launch → Metrics & Decisions
```

## Cross-links to key frameworks
- Strategy: OKRs, Roadmap, North Star, Prioritization
- Discovery: Research Interviews, Opportunity Assessment, Idea Validation, Problem-Solution-Space
- Execution: PRD, Daily Rituals, Metrics
- Communication: Stakeholder Management, One-Pagers

## AI collaboration prompt (optional)
```
Act as a product coach. Help me set up this initiative folder.
Context: [product/area], goal: [goal], stage: [idea/validation/build].
Quiz me to braindump first, then suggest which docs to create next and why.
```

## Maintenance notes
- Keep file links pointing to the canonical templates in `02-Methods-and-Tools/`.
- Update the lifecycle flow if your team’s process differs.
- Keep the decision log (`decisions.md`) current; it’s the history of why.
