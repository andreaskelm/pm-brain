# [Framework Name] Framework

> **Template Instructions:** Replace `[Framework Name]` with your actual framework name. Fill in all `[placeholders]` with relevant content. Remove this instruction block when done.

## Overview

[2-3 paragraphs explaining what the framework is, why it matters, and its core value. Include context about when it emerged or who developed it if relevant.]

**Purpose:** [One sentence - e.g., "This framework helps product teams [primary function] by [key mechanism]."]

**Core Value:** [One sentence - e.g., "Enables [outcome] while [avoiding common problem]."]

## Step 0: Braindump & Product Sense (Do this first!)

⚠️ **Don't jump straight to templates.**

**Braindump first:** See [`PRODUCT-SENSE-RULES.md`](../../../PRODUCT-SENSE-RULES.md) for the golden rule and workflow.

**Use prompts from:** [`2-product-sense-prompts.md`](../../2.0-Foundations/2.0.1-Mental-Models/6-Product-Sense-Development/2-product-sense-prompts.md) for the relevant situation (e.g., "Before Writing a PRD", "Before Making a Prioritization Decision", "Before User Research / Discovery", "Before a Product Strategy Session").

**Quick start (top 3-4 questions from the prompts file):**
- [Pick the most relevant questions from the canonical prompts file for this framework's context]
- [See prompts file for full list organized by situation]

**Bias check:** See Foundations: `../../2.0-Foundations/README.md` (Bias Framework) for bias awareness prompts.

**Capture your initial thoughts:**

- Write down your gut reactions before using the framework
- Note what feels strong vs. weak
- Identify any red flags your intuition is raising

**Then proceed** to use the framework to structure, validate, and deepen your initial product sense.

## Template Notes

**When to use Full Framework:**
- Framework is complex or strategic
- Deep understanding is required
- Edge cases matter
- Teaching/onboarding context

- ✅ Builds deep understanding
- ✅ Enables independent use

**Cons of Full Framework:**
- ❌ Longer to read (20-30 minutes)
- ❌ May overwhelm beginners
- ❌ Requires more maintenance
