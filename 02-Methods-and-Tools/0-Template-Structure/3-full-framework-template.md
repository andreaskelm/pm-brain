# [Framework Name] Framework

> **Template Instructions:** Replace `[Framework Name]` with your actual framework name. Fill in all `[placeholders]` with relevant content. Remove this instruction block when done.

## Overview

[2-3 paragraphs explaining what the framework is, why it matters, and its core value. Include context about when it emerged or who developed it if relevant.]

**Purpose:** [One sentence - e.g., "This framework helps product teams [primary function] by [key mechanism]."]

**Core Value:** [One sentence - e.g., "Enables [outcome] while [avoiding common problem]."]

## Step 0: Braindump & Product Sense (Do this first!)

**Before using [Framework Name], braindump:**

- [Braindump prompt 1 - e.g., "What outcomes are you trying to achieve? Dump everything - don't structure yet."]
- [Braindump prompt 2 - e.g., "What does your product sense tell you? What feels right or wrong?"]
- [Braindump prompt 3 - e.g., "What assumptions are you making? List them explicitly."]
- [Braindump prompt 4 - e.g., "What biases might affect your view? (e.g., Vanity metrics? Activity vs. outcome?)"]

**Product sense exercise:**

- [Question 1 - e.g., "If you had to pick ONE outcome that matters most, what would it be? Why?"]
- [Question 2 - e.g., "What would make you say 'this is obviously wrong'?"]
- [Question 3 - e.g., "What would make you say 'this is obviously right'?"]
- [Question 4 - e.g., "What does your intuition tell you about [key aspect]?"]

**Bias check:**

- [Bias awareness prompt 1 - e.g., "What biases might be affecting your view?"]
- [Bias awareness prompt 2 - e.g., "Are you seeing what you want to see, or what's actually there?"]

**Capture your initial thoughts:**

- Write down your gut reactions before using the framework
- Note what feels strong vs. weak
- Identify any red flags your intuition is raising

**Then proceed** to use the framework to structure, validate, and deepen your initial product sense.
