# [Code] – [Domain Name] Overview

> Replace `[Code]` with the folder code (e.g., 2.1) and `[Domain Name]` with the domain (e.g., Strategy). Remove this instruction block when done.

## What this domain is for
[One paragraph: what lives here and why it matters. Who should come here and for what kinds of problems.]

**Who this is for / when you’re here**
- **Junior PMs:** [What they gain; how to use this domain quickly]
- **Senior PMs:** [What they gain; how to navigate fast]

## Before using anything here (recommended)
- Braindump: What are you trying to do? Dump everything first.
- Product sense: What feels right/wrong about this problem?
- Bias check: What biases might be affecting you? (list 2–3 domain-relevant biases)
- Reflection: What would make this obviously right/wrong?

## How this is organized
Briefly list the subfolders with “use when” guidance.
- `[code-folder]/` — [What it covers]. **Use when:** [Situation].
- `[code-folder]/` — [What it covers]. **Use when:** [Situation].
- `[code-folder]/` — [What it covers]. **Use when:** [Situation].

## Typical flows
Show how items in this domain chain together.
Example:
```
[Framework A] → [Framework B] → [Framework C] → (handoff to other domain)
```

## When to use what (quick guide)
| Situation | Go to | Why |
|-----------|-------|-----|
| [Task/need] | `[path]` | [Reason] |
| [Task/need] | `[path]` | [Reason] |
| [Task/need] | `[path]` | [Reason] |

## Related domains / cross-links
- Strategy ↔ Discovery ↔ Execution ↔ Communication (adjust per domain)
- Foundations (mental models, bias, self-reflection) that support this domain
- Template Structure: `../0-Template-Structure/` (for creating new frameworks)

## AI collaboration prompt (optional)
```
Act as a product coach. I’m in the [Domain Name] area. My goal: [goal].
Help me braindump first, then suggest where to start in this domain. Challenge my assumptions and bias.
```

## Maintenance notes
- Keep “How this is organized” and “When to use what” current.
- Update flows when frameworks are added/removed.
- Add/remove “Before using…” prompts if the domain needs them.
