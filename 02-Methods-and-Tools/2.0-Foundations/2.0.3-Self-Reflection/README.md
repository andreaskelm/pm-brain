# Self-Reflection Framework

## Introduction

Use this framework to develop self-awareness, learn from experience, and improve your product judgment. Regular reflection helps you catch biases, develop product sense, and become a better product manager.

**When to use self-reflection:**
- After completing a framework or process (strategy, PRD, discovery, validation)
- After major decisions or launches
- When something didn't go as expected
- Weekly/monthly personal retrospectives
- When you want to develop your product sense

**When reflection might not be needed:**
- Very routine, low-stakes tasks
- When you're in pure execution mode with no learning opportunity

## How to Use This Framework

1. **After completing work**: Use reflection prompts to capture learnings
2. **Regular cadence**: Set aside time weekly/monthly for reflection
3. **Before starting new work**: Reflect on what you learned from similar past work
4. **When things go wrong**: Use reflection to understand what happened and learn
