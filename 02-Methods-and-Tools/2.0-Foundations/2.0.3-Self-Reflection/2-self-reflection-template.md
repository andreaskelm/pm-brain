# Self-Reflection: [Framework/Process Name] - [Date]

## What I Did
- Framework/process used: [e.g., Product Strategy, PRD, Discovery]
- Context: [Brief description of what you were working on]
- Outcome: [What happened? What did you produce?]

## What I Learned

### Surprises
- [What surprised you? What didn't you expect?]

### How My Thinking Evolved

- [Assumption 2] — [Why it was wrong]

### Assumptions That Were Right
- [Assumption 1] — [Why it was right]
- [Assumption 2] — [Why it was right]

## Product Sense Development

### What My Product Sense Told Me
- [What did your intuition/gut tell you?]
- [Was it right or wrong? Why?]

### What Great Product Sense Would Notice
- [What would an experienced PM notice that you missed?]
- [What would they do differently?]

### How to Develop Better Judgment
- [How can you develop better product sense?]
- [What examples can you learn from?]

## Bias Awareness

### Biases That Affected Me
