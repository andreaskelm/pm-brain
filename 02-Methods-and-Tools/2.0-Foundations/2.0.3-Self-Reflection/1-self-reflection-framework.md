# Self-Reflection Framework

## Step 0: Braindump & Product Sense (Do this first!)

**Before reflecting, braindump:**
- What did you just work on? Dump everything - don't structure yet.
- What does your product sense tell you about what happened? What feels right or wrong?
- What assumptions did you make? List them explicitly.
- What biases might have affected your thinking? (Confirmation? Anchoring? Sunk cost?)

**Product sense exercise:**
- If you had to explain what happened to a mentor, what would you say?
- What would make you say "this outcome was obviously wrong"?
- What would make you say "this outcome was obviously right"?

**Bias check:**
- What biases might have affected your view? (Confirmation bias? Solution bias? Sunk cost fallacy?)

## Overview

Self-reflection helps you develop product sense, catch biases, and learn from experience. This framework provides structured prompts to help you think critically about your work and decisions.

**Purpose:** Build self-awareness and improve product judgment through regular reflection.

**What it is:** A structured approach to learning from experience through honest self-assessment, bias awareness, and product sense development.

**Why it matters:** Regular reflection accelerates learning, improves decision-making, and develops product intuition faster than experience alone.

**When to use it:**
- After completing frameworks or processes (strategy, PRD, discovery, validation)
- After major decisions or launches
- Weekly/monthly personal retrospectives
- When something didn't go as expected
- When you want to develop your product sense

**When it might not be needed:**
- Very routine, low-stakes tasks
- When you're in pure execution mode with no learning opportunity

## Framework Structure

This framework consists of:

1. **Reflection Prompts** - Structured questions organized by context (after any framework, strategic work, discovery, validation)
2. **Product Sense Exercises** - Specific exercises to develop intuition and judgment
3. **How to Use** - Step-by-step process for conducting reflection
4. **Common Patterns** - Recognition of typical reflection patterns and their meanings
5. **LLM Helper Prompts** - AI collaboration prompts for reflection support

The framework is designed to be flexible—use the prompts that match your context, don't try to answer everything.

## Core Philosophy

### What This Framework Is NOT

- **Not a performance review** - This is for learning, not evaluation
- **Not a blame session** - Focus on learning, not fault-finding
- **Not a one-time activity** - Regular reflection builds compound learning
- **Not about perfection** - It's about awareness and continuous improvement

### Core Principles

### 1. Reflect Regularly
- After completing frameworks or processes
- After major decisions
- Weekly/monthly personal retrospectives
- When things don't go as expected

### 2. Be Honest
- Acknowledge mistakes and biases
- Don't rationalize failures
- Celebrate learnings, not just successes

### 3. Focus on Product Sense
- How did your intuition guide you?
- What did your product sense tell you?
- How can you develop better judgment?

### 4. Catch Biases
- What biases affected your thinking?
- How did you catch them (or miss them)?
- What will you watch for next time?

## Reflection Prompts

### After Using Any Framework

**What did you learn?**
- What surprised you?
- What did you expect that didn't happen?
- What didn't you expect that did happen?

**How did your thinking evolve?**
- How did your initial braindump compare to your final output?
- What changed your mind? Why?
- What assumptions were wrong? Right?

**Product sense development:**
- What did your product sense tell you? Was it right?
- What would great product sense notice that you missed?
- How can you develop better judgment?

**Bias awareness:**
- What biases affected your thinking? (Confirmation? Solution? Sunk cost?)
- How did you catch them (or miss them)?
- What will you watch for next time?

**What would you do differently?**
- If you did this again, what would you change?
- What would you do the same?
- What's your biggest takeaway?

### After Strategic Work

**Strategic thinking:**
- Did you focus on outcomes or solutions?
- How did you balance short-term vs. long-term?
- What strategic trade-offs did you make? Were they right?

**Stakeholder management:**
- How did you balance different stakeholder needs?
- What conflicts did you navigate? How?
- What would you do differently in stakeholder management?

### After Discovery Work

**Customer understanding:**
- How did your understanding of customers evolve?
- What surprised you about customer needs?
- What biases affected your customer research?

**Evidence vs. assumptions:**
- What did you assume that turned out wrong?
- What evidence changed your mind?
- How can you gather better evidence next time?

### After Validation Work

**Risk assessment:**
- What risks did you identify? Miss?
- How did validation change your confidence?
- What would you validate differently?

**Decision-making:**
- How did you use evidence to make decisions?
- What would you decide differently with hindsight?
- What decision criteria worked? Didn't work?

## Product Sense Exercises

### Exercise 1: Gut Check Reflection
- What did your gut tell you at the start?
- Was your gut right or wrong? Why?
- How can you develop better intuition?

### Exercise 2: Expert PM Perspective
- What would an experienced PM notice that you missed?
- What would they do differently?
- How can you develop that perspective?

### Exercise 3: Bias Audit
- List all biases that might have affected you
- Which ones did you catch? Which did you miss?
- What will you watch for next time?

### Exercise 4: Product Taste Development
- What feels "right" or "wrong" about your work? Why?
- How can you develop better product taste?
- What examples of great product sense can you learn from?

## How to Use This Framework

### Step 1: Set Aside Time
- 15-30 minutes after completing work
- Weekly 30-minute reflection sessions
- Monthly deeper reflection (1-2 hours)

### Step 2: Choose Relevant Prompts
- Pick prompts that match what you just did
- Don't try to answer everything - focus on what matters
- Be honest and specific

### Step 3: Write It Down
- Use the reflection template or just free-form
- Capture learnings while they're fresh
- Review past reflections to see patterns

### Step 4: Act on Learnings
- What will you do differently next time?
- What patterns do you notice across reflections?
- How are you developing as a PM?

## When to Use / When Not to Use

### Works Best For

- **After completing frameworks** - Capture learnings while fresh
- **After major decisions** - Understand what influenced your thinking
- **Regular cadence** - Weekly/monthly retrospectives build compound learning
- **When things go wrong** - Understand what happened and learn
- **Product sense development** - Develop intuition through structured reflection

### May Not Be Ideal For

- **Very routine tasks** - Low learning value, high overhead
- **Pure execution mode** - When there's no decision-making or learning opportunity
- **Time-constrained situations** - Quick mental notes may be sufficient
- **When you're already reflecting naturally** - Don't add structure if informal reflection works

### Alternatives to Consider

- **Quick mental notes** - For low-stakes situations
- **Team retrospectives** - When learning is shared/collective
- **Formal reviews** - When evaluation is needed (different purpose)

## Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Rationalizing Failures

**Warning signs:**
- "It would have worked if..."
- Blaming external factors without self-reflection
- Focusing on what others did wrong

**Why it's a problem:**
- Prevents learning from mistakes
- Reinforces bad patterns
- Misses opportunities for growth

**Solution:**
- Acknowledge your role honestly
- Ask "What could I have done differently?"
- Focus on what you control

### Pitfall 2: Only Reflecting on Failures

**Warning signs:**
- Only reflecting when things go wrong
- Not capturing what worked well
- Missing patterns in successes

**Why it's a problem:**
- Don't learn what to repeat
- Miss understanding why things worked
- Can't build on strengths

**Solution:**
- Reflect on successes too
- Ask "What made this work?"
- Build on patterns that lead to good outcomes

### Pitfall 3: Not Acting on Learnings

**Warning signs:**
- Same patterns repeating across reflections
- Not changing behavior based on insights
- Reflection becomes a ritual without impact

**Why it's a problem:**
- Reflection without action doesn't improve outcomes
- Wastes time
- Creates false sense of learning

**Solution:**
- Always end with "What will I do differently?"
- Track patterns across reflections
- Set specific actions for next time

### Pitfall 4: Being Too Hard on Yourself

**Warning signs:**
- Only focusing on mistakes
- Perfectionist thinking
- Not celebrating learnings

**Why it's a problem:**
- Reduces motivation to reflect
- Creates negative association
- Misses growth opportunities

**Solution:**
- Balance self-critique with self-compassion
- Celebrate learnings, not just successes
- Recognize progress over time

## Best Practices

### Do's

- **Reflect regularly** - Build it into your routine (weekly/monthly)
- **Be honest** - Acknowledge mistakes and biases without rationalization
- **Write it down** - Capture learnings while they're fresh
- **Focus on product sense** - Develop intuition through reflection
- **Act on learnings** - Change behavior based on insights
- **Review past reflections** - Look for patterns over time
- **Use prompts flexibly** - Pick what matches your context
- **Celebrate learnings** - Not just successes, but growth

### Don'ts

- **Don't rationalize failures** - Acknowledge your role honestly
- **Don't skip the braindump** - Start with unstructured thinking
- **Don't only reflect on failures** - Learn from successes too
- **Don't make it a chore** - Keep it meaningful and focused
- **Don't ignore patterns** - Look for recurring themes
- **Don't reflect without action** - Always end with "what will I do differently?"
- **Don't be too hard on yourself** - Balance critique with compassion
- **Don't skip bias awareness** - Always check for biases affecting your view

## Common Reflection Patterns

**Pattern: "I assumed X but Y happened"**
- Learning: Challenge assumptions earlier
- Action: Add assumption-checking to your process

**Pattern: "My product sense told me X and I was right/wrong"**
- Learning: Develop intuition through experience
- Action: Track when your gut is right vs. wrong

**Pattern: "I fell into bias X again"**
- Learning: This bias is a blind spot for you
- Action: Add specific bias-checking to your process

**Pattern: "I didn't braindump first and jumped to structure"**
- Learning: Braindumping helps you think better
- Action: Always braindump before structuring

## LLM Helper Prompts

Use this prompt with AI tools to help you reflect:

```markdown
Act as a product management coach helping me reflect on my work. Your role is to help me think, not to think for me.

1) Ask me to describe what I just did:
- What framework or process did I complete?
- What was the outcome?
- What went well? What didn't?

2) Help me reflect:
- "What did you learn? What surprised you?"
- "How did your thinking evolve from your initial braindump?"
- "What does your product sense tell you about what happened?"
- "What biases affected your thinking? How did you catch them (or miss them)?"

3) Help me develop product sense:
- "What would an experienced PM notice that you missed?"
- "What would great product sense look like here?"
- "How can you develop better judgment?"

4) Help me plan improvements:
- "What will you do differently next time?"
- "What patterns do you notice across your reflections?"
- "How are you developing as a PM?"

I'll start by telling you what I just worked on.
```
