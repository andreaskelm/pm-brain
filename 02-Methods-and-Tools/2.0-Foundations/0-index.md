# Foundations Library

**What this file is:** Index of **everything in 2.0 Foundations only** — mental models (Decision-Making, Product-Thinking, Work-Levels, etc.) plus Bias and Self-Reflection. For frameworks **across** Strategy, Discovery, Execution, and Communication (by topic), see [1-frameworks-by-topic.md](../1-frameworks-by-topic.md) at the root of `02-Methods-and-Tools/`.

This library gives quick access to all mental models and foundational frameworks in the PM Brain system. Mental models are quick-reference thinking tools; frameworks here provide structured processes and templates.

## Mental Models

Mental models are organized by category. Each provides a quick lens for thinking about product challenges.

### Decision-Making

- **[Pre-mortems](2.0.1-Mental-Models/1-Decision-Making/1-pre-mortems.md)** - Risk identification by imagining failure
- **[One-Way vs Two-Way Doors](2.0.1-Mental-Models/1-Decision-Making/2-one-way-two-way-doors.md)** - Matching decision speed to reversibility
- **[Assumptions Framework](2.0.1-Mental-Models/1-Decision-Making/3-assumptions-framework.md)** - Understanding root causes of disagreements
- [First Principles](2.0.1-Mental-Models/1-Decision-Making/4-first-principles.md) - *TODO*

- [Regret Minimization](2.0.1-Mental-Models/1-Decision-Making/6-regret-minimization.md) - *TODO*

### Product-Thinking

- **[Outcome vs Output](2.0.1-Mental-Models/2-Product-Thinking/1-outcome-vs-output.md)** - Distinguish outputs from outcomes

- **[Feature Factory](2.0.1-Mental-Models/2-Product-Thinking/3-feature-factory.md)** - Diagnostic for output-heavy cultures
- **[Four Risks of Product Management](2.0.1-Mental-Models/2-Product-Thinking/4-four-risks.md)** - Value, viability, usability, feasibility risks
- **[Jobs vs Features](2.0.1-Mental-Models/2-Product-Thinking/5-jobs-vs-features.md)** - *TODO*
- **[0-1 vs 1-100](2.0.1-Mental-Models/2-Product-Thinking/6-zero-to-one-vs-one-to-one-hundred.md)** - Adapting approach to product stage
- **[Build-Measure-Learn](2.0.1-Mental-Models/2-Product-Thinking/7-build-measure-learn.md)** - *TODO: confirm scope/keep?*

### Execution-Hygiene

- [Deep Work vs Shallow Work](2.0.1-Mental-Models/4-Execution-Hygiene/1-deep-work-shallow-work.md) - *TODO*
- [Eisenhower Matrix](2.0.1-Mental-Models/4-Execution-Hygiene/2-eisenhower-matrix.md) - *TODO*
- [LNO Framework](2.0.1-Mental-Models/4-Execution-Hygiene/3-lno-framework.md) - *TODO*

### Team-Dynamics

- **[Alignment Check](2.0.1-Mental-Models/5-Team-Dynamics/1-alignment-check.md)** - Diagnostic for hidden misalignment
- [Disagree and Commit](2.0.1-Mental-Models/5-Team-Dynamics/2-disagree-and-commit.md) - *TODO*
- [Empowered Teams](2.0.1-Mental-Models/5-Team-Dynamics/3-empowered-teams.md) - *TODO*
- [Strong Opinions, Loosely Held](2.0.1-Mental-Models/5-Team-Dynamics/4-strong-opinions-loosely-held.md) - *TODO*

### Work-Levels

- **[Tactical, Operational, Strategic Work Levels](2.0.1-Mental-Models/3-Work-Levels/1-tactical-operational-strategic.md)**
- **[Three Levels of Product Work](2.0.1-Mental-Models/3-Work-Levels/2-three-levels-of-work.md)**
- **[60-30-10 Framework](2.0.1-Mental-Models/3-Work-Levels/3-sixty-thirty-ten.md)** - Roadmap allocation (60/30/10)

## Full Frameworks

These are comprehensive frameworks with detailed processes, templates, and guidance.

### [Self-Reflection Framework](2.0.3-Self-Reflection/README.md)
Develop self-awareness, learn from experience, and improve product judgment through structured reflection prompts and exercises.

**Use when:**
- After completing frameworks or processes
- After major decisions or launches
- Weekly/monthly personal retrospectives
- When something didn't go as expected

### [Cognitive Bias Framework](2.0.2-Bias/README.md)
Recognize and mitigate cognitive biases that distort decision-making. Includes top 10 biases for PMs, detection methods, and debiasing strategies.

**Use when:**
- Before major decisions
- During prioritization
- When evaluating opportunities
- During strategy planning
