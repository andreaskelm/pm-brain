# 2.0 Foundations – Domain Overview

Foundational thinking tools and self-awareness frameworks that support every PM activity. Come here to sharpen judgment, reduce bias, and build product sense before applying process frameworks.

## Who this is for / when you’re here
- **Junior PMs:** Fast on-ramp to mental models; use quick references before strategy/discovery work.
- **Senior PMs:** Calibration and shared vocabulary for coaching, critiques, and decision quality.

## Before using anything here (recommended)

**Use prompts from:** [2-product-sense-prompts.md](2.0.1-Mental-Models/6-Product-Sense-Development/2-product-sense-prompts.md) — [Generic Step 0](2.0.1-Mental-Models/6-Product-Sense-Development/2-product-sense-prompts.md#generic-step-0-any-framework) for any framework; [Before Self-Reflection](2.0.1-Mental-Models/6-Product-Sense-Development/2-product-sense-prompts.md#before-self-reflection) for retros.

**Quick start:** What are you trying to decide or learn? What feels right/wrong? What assumptions? Which biases are likely? What would make this obviously right or wrong in hindsight? **See prompts file for full list.**

## How this is organized
- `2.0.1-Mental-Models/` — Quick lenses for decisions, product thinking, execution hygiene, team dynamics, and work levels. **Use when:** You need fast framing before deeper work.
- `2.0.2-Bias/` — Cognitive bias framework and checklist. **Use when:** Preparing major decisions or calibrating estimates.
- `2.0.3-Self-Reflection/` — Reflection framework and template. **Use when:** After launches/decisions or during regular retros.
- `0-index.md` — Library-style index for quick navigation.

## Typical flows
```
Mental model (framing) → Bias checklist → Core framework (e.g., OKR/PRD/Discovery) → Self-reflection
```

## When to use what (quick guide)
| Situation | Go to | Why |
|-----------|-------|-----|
| Product / stakeholder / organization thinking (braindump first) | `2.0.1-Mental-Models/6-Product-Sense-Development/0-start-here-product-thinking.md` | Single entry: prompts → braindump → then framework |
| Need a fast lens before deciding | `2.0.1-Mental-Models/` | Quick framing and vocabulary |
| Worried about decision quality/bias | `2.0.2-Bias/1-bias-framework.md` | Checklist + debiasing strategies |
| Post-launch or weekly retro | `2.0.3-Self-Reflection/2-self-reflection-template.md` | Structured prompts to capture learning |
| Navigating work scope/stage | `2.0.1-Mental-Models/3-Work-Levels/` | Align effort to altitude and stage |

## AI collaboration prompt (optional)
```
Act as a product coach. I’m in the Foundations domain.
My goal: [goal]. Help me braindump first, then point me to the right
mental model, bias check, or reflection template. Challenge my
assumptions and likely biases.
```

## Maintenance notes
- Keep “How this is organized” and quick guide paths current with renames.
- Flag TODOs in mental models until content is filled; remove TODO markers once populated.
- Review cross-links when other domains move or rename.
