# Cognitive Bias Framework

## Introduction

This framework helps product teams recognize and mitigate cognitive biases that distort decision-making. Cognitive biases are NOT character flaws—they're systematic patterns of thinking that all humans experience.

## How to Use This Framework

### Step 0: Braindump & Reflect (Critical!)

**Use prompts from:** [2-product-sense-prompts.md](../../2.0.1-Mental-Models/6-Product-Sense-Development/2-product-sense-prompts.md) → [Generic Step 0 (any framework)](../../2.0.1-Mental-Models/6-Product-Sense-Development/2-product-sense-prompts.md#generic-step-0-any-framework). Then use the bias checklist in this folder.

**Quick start:** What decision are you making? What does your product sense tell you? What assumptions? What biases might be affecting you? Defend to a skeptic; what would make you say "obviously biased"? **See prompts file for full list.**
- What would make you say "this decision is obviously sound"?

### Step 1: Review Framework
Read `1-bias-framework.md` to understand common biases and debiasing strategies

### Step 2: Use Bias Checklist
Before major decisions, use the bias decision checklist

### Step 3: Apply Debiasing Strategies
Use appropriate debiasing methods for the biases you identify

### Step 4: Document Assumptions
Track assumptions and test them over time

### Step 5: Review Outcomes
Compare predictions to actual outcomes to calibrate

### Step 6: Self-Reflection
After decisions, reflect:
- What biases did you catch?
- What biases did you miss?
- How can you improve next time?

## When to Use

- Before major decisions
- During prioritization
- When evaluating opportunities
- During strategy planning
- When making estimates

## How to Maintain

- **Pre-Decision**: Use bias checklist before major decisions
- **Weekly**: Review recent decisions for bias patterns
- **Monthly**: Conduct bias audit of decision portfolio
- **Quarterly**: Full bias framework review and team training
