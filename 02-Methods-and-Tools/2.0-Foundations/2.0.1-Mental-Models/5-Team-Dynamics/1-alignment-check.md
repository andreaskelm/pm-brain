# Alignment Check

## What It Is
A simple diagnostic to surface hidden misalignment before it derails execution. Ask each team member independently: "What are our top 3 priorities and how do we measure success?" Compare responses to reveal gaps between what people think they're working toward.

## How to Think With It
Teams often assume they're aligned when they're not. This check prevents wasted effort on competing priorities by explicitly comparing each person's definition of success and timeframes. The expected result is different definitions of success, which exposes the real problem: everyone working hard in different directions.

## Framework Structure

| Element | Description | Purpose |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Core Question** | "What are our top 3 priorities and how do we measure success?" | Reveals gaps between what people think they're working toward |
| **Expected Result** | Different definitions of success and timeframes | Exposes the real problem: everyone working hard in different directions |

## Warning Signs of Misalignment
- Multiple functional plans stapled together as "the plan"
- High effort, low meaningful output
- Team frustration despite individual hard work

## Process
1. **Ask each team member** the core question independently
2. **Compare responses** for consistency in priorities and success metrics
3. **Surface differences** openly in team discussion
4. **Align on shared definition** before proceeding with execution

**Key Insight:** Teams often assume they're aligned when they're not. This simple check prevents wasted effort on competing priorities.

## When to Apply
- When teams show high effort but low meaningful output
- When multiple functional plans are stapled together as "the plan"
- When team frustration exists despite individual hard work
- Before starting major initiatives or sprints

## PM Example
Before a quarter starts, ask each team member independently: "What are our top 3 priorities?" If responses vary significantly—some say "user acquisition," others say "retention," others say "new features"—you've identified misalignment. Surface differences openly and align on shared definition before proceeding.
