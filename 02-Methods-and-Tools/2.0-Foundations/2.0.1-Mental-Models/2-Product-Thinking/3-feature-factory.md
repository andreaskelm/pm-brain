# Feature Factory

**Mental model by:** John Cutler
**What it is:** Diagnostic lens for recognizing when teams focus on outputs over outcomes

## What It Is
Feature Factory is a pattern where teams measure success by features shipped rather than outcomes achieved.

## How to Think With It
Ask: "Are we measuring success by what we ship or what we achieve?"

## Framework Structure

| Feature Factory | Outcome-Oriented |
|-----------------|------------------|
| "How many features shipped?" | "What outcomes improved?" |
| Celebrate launches | Celebrate impact |
| Roadmap = feature list | Roadmap = outcome bets |
| Success = on-time delivery | Success = customer value |
| Teams deliver specs | Teams solve problems |

## The Lens
Use the table to diagnose whether teams optimize for activity (feature factory) or impact (outcome-oriented).

## When to Apply
- Team feels busy but not impactful
- Lots of releases, little measurable progress
- Stakeholders demand more features
- Metrics don't improve despite shipping

## PM Example
**Feature Factory:** "We shipped 15 features this quarter!"
**Outcome-Oriented:** "We improved retention 12% by solving X customer problem"

## Combines With
- Outcome vs. Output (Marty Cagan)
- OKR Framework (measure outcomes)
- Four Risks (are we solving for outputs?)
