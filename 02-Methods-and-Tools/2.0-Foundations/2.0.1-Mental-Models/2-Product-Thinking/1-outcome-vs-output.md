# Outcome vs. Output

**Mental model by:** Marty Cagan (Silicon Valley Product Group)  
**What it is:** Distinction between what you build (output) and what you achieve (outcome)

## What It Is
Output = features, releases, stories shipped.  
Outcome = business results, customer behavior changes, metrics moved.

## How to Think With It
Before defining success, ask: "Are we measuring output or outcome?" Favor outcomes first, then choose outputs that drive them.

## When to Apply
- Setting goals (OKRs, roadmap)
- Defining success criteria
- Evaluating team performance
- Communicating to stakeholders

## PM Example
- **Output thinking:** "Ship user profiles feature by Q2."
- **Outcome thinking:** "Increase engagement 15% through better personalization."

## Framework Structure
- **Outcome Definition:** Desired behavior/metric change.  
- **Output Options:** Candidate features or experiments.  
- **Traceability:** Map each output to the target outcome; drop outputs without clear linkage.

## The Lens

| Output | Outcome |
|--------|---------|
| Features shipped | Metrics improved |
| Stories completed | Problems solved |
| Releases deployed | Value delivered |
| Team velocity | Business results |
| Activity | Impact |

## Combines With
- Feature Factory (diagnostic)
- Strategy: `../../2.1-Strategy/README.md` (OKR Framework for outcome-based goals, North Star Metric to anchor outcomes)

## Common Mistakes
- Confusing shipping with success
- Measuring only activities
- Not connecting outputs to outcomes
