# Four Risks of Product Management

**Mental model by:** Marty Cagan (SVPG)
**What it is:** Framework for identifying and addressing four types of product risk

## What It Is
Every product idea faces four risks that must be addressed before building.

## How to Think With It
Before building, ask: "Which of these four risks are we addressing?"

## Framework Structure

### The Four Risks

| Risk | Question | Addresses |
|------|----------|-----------|
| **Value Risk** | Will customers buy/use it? | Desirability |
| **Viability Risk** | Does it work for our business? | Business fit |
| **Usability Risk** | Can users figure out how to use it? | User experience |
| **Feasibility Risk** | Can we build it? | Technical capability |

## When to Apply
- Discovery phase (before building)
- Evaluating ideas/opportunities
- Planning prototypes and tests
- Diagnosing why something failed

## Detailed Breakdown

### Value Risk (Will customers use it?)
**Questions:**
- Will customers choose this over alternatives?
- Does it solve a real problem?
- Will they pay for it?

**How to test:**
- User interviews
- Prototypes
- Demand tests

### Viability Risk (Does it work for business?)
**Questions:**
- Is it legal/compliant?
- Does it fit our business model?
- Can we market/sell/support it?
- Does it align with strategy?

**How to test:**
- Stakeholder reviews
- Business model validation
- Legal/compliance review

### Usability Risk (Can users use it?)
**Questions:**
- Can users figure it out?
- Is it accessible?
- Is the UX good enough?

**How to test:**
- Usability testing
- Prototype testing
- Design reviews

### Feasibility Risk (Can we build it?)
**Questions:**
- Is it technically possible?
- Do we have the skills/resources?
- How long will it take?
- What are dependencies?

**How to test:**
- Technical spikes
- Architecture reviews
- Proof-of-concepts

## PM Example
**Idea:** AI-powered meal planning

**Four Risks:**
- Value: Will people trust AI recommendations?
- Viability: Can we afford AI inference costs at scale?
- Usability: Can users understand AI suggestions?
- Feasibility: Do we have ML expertise?

## Combines With
- Continuous Discovery Habits (how to test risks)
- Opportunity Assessment (document risk mitigation)
- Idea Validation (structured risk testing)

## Common Mistakes
- Only addressing feasibility ("can we build it?")
- Assuming value risk is low
- Not involving stakeholders (viability)
- Skipping usability testing
