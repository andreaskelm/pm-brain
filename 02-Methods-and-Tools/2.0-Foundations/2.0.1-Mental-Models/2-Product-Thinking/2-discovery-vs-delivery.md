# Discovery vs Delivery

## What It Is
Two complementary modes: **Discovery** (reduce uncertainty by learning) and **Delivery** (execute validated work predictably). Clear mode choice avoids mixing exploration expectations with execution promises.

## How to Think With It
Name the mode explicitly. In discovery, optimize for learning velocity, fast bets, and evidence. In delivery, optimize for predictability, quality, and stakeholder confidence. Switch modes once evidence is strong enough.

## When to Apply
- Planning quarters and staffing (different cadence/tools per mode)
- Deciding process rigor vs exploration
- Managing stakeholder expectations on timelines and success measures

## PM Example
Team is asked for a delivery date while still testing problem-solution fit. They declare “we’re in discovery,” set weekly experiment readouts, and only commit delivery dates after meeting evidence thresholds.

## Framework Structure
- **Discovery Mode:** Hypotheses, experiments, evidence thresholds, weekly readouts
- **Delivery Mode:** Backlog, delivery milestones, quality gates, release plan
- **Switching Criteria:** Evidence threshold met (problem, solution, model) + readiness to commit dates

## Combines With
- One-Way vs Two-Way Doors (`../1-Decision-Making/2-one-way-two-way-doors.md`)
- 0-1 vs 1-100 (`6-zero-to-one-vs-one-to-one-hundred.md`)
