# Jobs vs Features

## What It Is
Reframes roadmaps from shipping features to serving customer jobs (desired outcomes in context). Keeps teams focused on progress customers are trying to make rather than specific UI ideas.

## How to Think With It
Start with the job and context (“When I... I want to... so I can...”). Generate multiple solutions, then choose the smallest to validate the job outcome. Treat feature requests as signals of underlying jobs.

## When to Apply
- Roadmap definition (align bets to jobs/outcomes)
- Opportunity sizing (how many users have this job + intensity)
- Backlog grooming (translate feature requests into jobs, then solutions)

## PM Example
Stakeholders ask for “export to CSV.” Reframe: “When analysts share results, they want reusable outputs to avoid rework.” Solutions considered: exports, shared views, email digests. Team tests shared views first because it better serves the job.

## Framework Structure
- **Job Statement:** “When I [situation], I want to [progress], so I can [result].”
- **Constraints/Context:** Triggers, frequency, existing workarounds, success signals
- **Solution Options:** Multiple ways to serve the job, smallest test first
