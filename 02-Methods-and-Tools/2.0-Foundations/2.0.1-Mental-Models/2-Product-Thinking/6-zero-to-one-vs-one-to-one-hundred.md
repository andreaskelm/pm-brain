# 0-1 vs 1-100

## What It Is
A mental model recognizing two distinct product stages: 0-1 focuses on discovery and product-market fit ("What should we build?"), while 1-100 focuses on scaling and optimization ("How do we scale what works?"). Success depends on recognizing your stage and adapting team structure, metrics, and mindset accordingly.

## How to Think With It
0-1 emphasizes learning, user problems, and rapid iteration with small, flexible teams validating assumptions before scaling. 1-100 focuses on execution, reliability, and efficiency with specialized teams optimizing and standardizing proven solutions. The key insight is adapting your approach to match the stage.

## Framework Structure

| Stage      | Focus                | Key Activities                        | Success Metrics                | Common Pitfalls                |
|------------|----------------------|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **0-1**    | Discovery & Fit      | User research, rapid prototyping, MVPs, hypothesis testing | User engagement, speed of learning, qualitative feedback | Over-engineering, skipping user validation, building for scale too early |
| **1-100**  | Scaling & Optimization | Performance, automation, process standardization, team specialization | Usage growth, system reliability, operational efficiency | Premature optimization, losing user focus, excessive complexity |

- **0-1:** "What should we build?" — Emphasize learning, user problems, and rapid iteration. Small, flexible teams validate assumptions before scaling.
- **1-100:** "How do we scale what works?" — Focus on execution, reliability, and efficiency. Specialized teams optimize and standardize proven solutions.
- **Key Insight:** Success depends on recognizing your stage and adapting team structure, metrics, and mindset accordingly.

## When to Apply
- When determining team structure and hiring needs
- When setting success metrics and KPIs
- When deciding between experimentation vs optimization
- When transitioning from startup to scale-up phase

## PM Example
A 0-1 product team uses qualitative feedback, rapid prototyping, and user engagement metrics. A 1-100 product team uses usage growth, system reliability, and operational efficiency metrics. Trying to use 1-100 metrics in 0-1 leads to premature optimization; using 0-1 approaches in 1-100 leads to chaos.
