# LNO Framework (Leverage / Neutral / Overhead)

## What It Is
Time-audit lens: classify tasks as **Leverage** (moves outcomes, multiplies impact), **Neutral** (necessary but not outcome-driving), or **Overhead** (administrivia). Goal: shift time toward leverage.

## How to Think With It
Label calendar blocks L/N/O weekly. Reduce O, streamline or batch N, and protect/expand L. Ask “what outcome did this block produce?” not “was I busy?”

## When to Apply
- Weekly time audits
- Prioritizing PM tasks
- Delegation and coaching discussions

## PM Example
PM tags last week: 40% Neutral status updates, 15% Overhead scheduling, 45% Leverage (strategy doc). They batch updates into one memo (N), automate scheduling (O), and free 3×1 hour for Leverage discovery calls.

## Framework Structure
- **Leverage:** Advances outcomes, reusable artifacts, decisions; do more, protect time
- **Neutral:** Required but not outcome-driving (status, sync); batch/shorten
- **Overhead:** Low-value admin; automate or eliminate

## Combines With
- Deep Work vs Shallow Work (`deep-work-shallow-work.md`)
- Tactical/Operational/Strategic (`../3-Work-Levels/1-tactical-operational-strategic.md`)
