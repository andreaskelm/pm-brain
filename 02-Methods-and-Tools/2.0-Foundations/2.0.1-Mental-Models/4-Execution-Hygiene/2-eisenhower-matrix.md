# Eisenhower Matrix

## What It Is
Prioritization matrix that separates urgency from importance to avoid living in fire drills and to protect important/not-urgent work.

## How to Think With It
Sort tasks into four quadrants, then design actions per quadrant. Calendar Q2 (important/not-urgent) first; minimize Q3; drop/automate Q4; handle Q1 with urgency but reduce their creation.

## When to Apply
- Weekly planning and load balancing
- Triage during fire-fighting weeks
- Coaching teams on prioritization hygiene

## PM Example
List incoming asks, classify them, then block 90 minutes for a Q2 task before touching Q3 emails. Move recurring Q3 items to async forms; decline Q4 work.

## Framework Structure
- **Quadrant I (Urgent/Important):** Crises, deadlines — do/mitigate quickly
- **Quadrant II (Not Urgent/Important):** Strategy, relationships, health — schedule first
- **Quadrant III (Urgent/Not Important):** Interruptions — delegate, set rules, time-box
- **Quadrant IV (Not Urgent/Not Important):** Distractions — drop or automate
