# Deep Work vs Shallow Work

## What It Is
Deep work = focused, cognitively heavy work that moves outcomes (strategy, synthesis, writing). Shallow work = coordination and reactive tasks. PMs need deliberate balance to avoid being calendar-maxed.

## How to Think With It
Protect deep work as the default for hard problems; batch shallow tasks. Treat interruptions as costly context switches. Schedule deep blocks when energy is highest.

## When to Apply
- Weekly planning and time audits
- Designing rituals to protect focus time
- Recovering from “Slack/meeting” weeks

## PM Example
Monday was all meetings, no product thinking. PM moves 3 meetings to one block, books 2×90-minute deep-work holds for strategy doc, and uses shallow blocks for comms.

## Framework Structure
- **Deep Work Criteria:** Requires focus, creates reusable assets, changes decisions
- **Shallow Work Criteria:** Coordination, updates, administrative work
- **Guardrails/Operating Rules:** Time blocks, meeting caps, batching comms, focus signals

## Combines With
- LNO Framework (`lno-framework.md`)
- Tactical/Operational/Strategic (`../3-Work-Levels/1-tactical-operational-strategic.md`)
