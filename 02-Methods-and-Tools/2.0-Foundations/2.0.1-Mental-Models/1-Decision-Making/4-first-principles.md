# First Principles Thinking

## What It Is

A problem-solving mental model that breaks down complex problems into their most fundamental, irreducible truths and rebuilds solutions from the ground up. Rather than reasoning by analogy (copying what exists with small variations), first principles thinking questions every assumption to discover what is actually true, enabling breakthrough innovation instead of incremental improvement.

## How to Think With It

### Reasoning by Analogy (Default Mode)

Most people solve problems by looking at what’s been done before and making small improvements. This is mentally easier but leads to incremental change and keeps you bound by existing constraints. Example: “Rockets are expensive because they’ve always been expensive.”

### Reasoning from First Principles (Innovation Mode)

Strip away all assumptions and conventions. Ask: “What do we know to be absolutely true?” Then reconstruct the solution using only these fundamental truths. This requires more mental energy but unlocks breakthrough solutions. Example: “What materials are rockets made of? What do those materials cost at commodity prices?”

### The Three-Step Process

1. **Identify and Question Assumptions**: Write down everything you think you know about the problem. Challenge each assumption: “Why is it done this way? Is this a law of nature or just convention?”
1. **Break Down to Fundamentals**: Deconstruct the problem to its most basic, undeniable components. Ask “why?” repeatedly (Five Whys technique) until you reach bedrock truth that cannot be reduced further.
1. **Reconstruct from Ground Up**: Build new solutions using only the fundamental truths you’ve identified, ignoring what’s been done before. Test hypotheses with real data.

## Framework Structure

|Approach |Process |Mental Effort |Outcome |Example |
|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|**Reasoning by Analogy** |Look at what exists → Make small improvements → Copy with variations |Low (mentally easier) |Incremental change, copy-cat solutions, bounded by current constraints|“Battery packs cost $600/kWh because they always have” |
|**First Principles Thinking**|Question assumptions → Break down to fundamentals → Rebuild from scratch|High (requires deep thinking)|Breakthrough innovation, novel solutions, unbounded creativity |“Battery materials cost $80/kWh on commodity markets—we just need clever assembly”|

### Key Contrasts

**What You’re Solving For:**

- **Analogy**: “How can we do what others do, but slightly better?”
- **First Principles**: “What is the actual problem we’re trying to solve, stripped of all convention?”

**Your Starting Point:**

- **Analogy**: Prior experiences, industry best practices, what competitors do
- **First Principles**: Fundamental truths, basic physics/economics, irreducible facts

**Your Constraints:**

- **Analogy**: Bound by existing approaches and historical precedent
- **First Principles**: Bound only by laws of nature and fundamental realities

**Your Questions:**

- **Analogy**: “How is this usually done? What’s worked before?”
- **First Principles**: “What is absolutely true? Why does this have to be this way?”

## When to Apply

- When facing complex, multifaceted problems with many variables
- When industry conventions seem arbitrary or outdated
- When incremental improvements aren’t enough
- When innovation and competitive advantage are critical
- When existing solutions are prohibitively expensive or inefficient
- When you need to challenge the status quo
- During product strategy development
- When stuck on a problem despite multiple attempts
- **When NOT to use**: Simple, well-solved problems; time-sensitive tactical decisions; when conventional solutions are adequate

## PM Example

**Analogy-Based PM Approach:**
Sees competitors have a 7-day free trial, implements 7-day trial. Notices competitors gate premium features, creates similar paywall. Result: Incremental improvement, same as everyone else.

**First Principles PM Approach:**
Asks: “What fundamentally drives conversion?” Breaks down to: Users need to experience core value + trust the product + have budget authority + perceive ongoing value. Discovers 7 days isn’t enough for users to complete key workflow in this domain. Rebuilds from fundamentals: Creates 30-day trial with guided onboarding focused on completing first valuable outcome within 5 days, plus automated ROI tracking. Result: Novel solution optimized for actual conversion mechanics, not industry convention.

**Product Teardown Example:**

- **Novice PM**: Jumps to UI/UX improvements based on what similar apps do
- **Experienced PM**: Starts with user, problem being solved, and product strategy; questions why features exist; identifies core user job-to-be-done; rebuilds solution from fundamental user needs

**Problem-Solving Example:**
Metric drops. Analogy-based thinking: “Let’s try what worked last time.” First principles: Ask “why?” five times to reach root cause, then solve the fundamental issue rather than treating symptoms.

## Common Pitfalls

- **Functional Fixedness**: Seeing things only in their traditional use, limiting creative solutions
- **Assumption Blindness**: Not recognizing your own assumptions as assumptions
- **Analysis Paralysis**: Over-deconstructing when a conventional solution is adequate
- **Ignoring Context**: Breaking down so far you lose sight of practical constraints
- **Reinventing Wheels**: Applying to problems that are already well-solved
- **Confirmation Bias**: Only questioning assumptions that support your preferred solution
