# One-Way vs Two-Way Door Decisions

## What It Is
A mental model for matching decision-making speed and rigor to the reversibility of the decision. Two-way doors are reversible, low-cost to undo; one-way doors are hard/impossible to reverse and have high impact.

## How to Think With It
Always ask "Is this a one-way or two-way door?" before deciding. Two-way doors favor speed and experimentation—if it fails, you can easily reverse course. One-way doors require thorough analysis and broad alignment—mistakes are costly or permanent.

## Framework Structure

| Type         | Description                        | Decision Process                | Examples (Data Platform)                |
|--------------|------------------------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **Two-Way**  | Reversible, low-cost to undo       | Decide quickly, experiment, empower teams | Tool selection, batch timing, alert thresholds |
| **One-Way**  | Hard/impossible to reverse, high impact | Slow down, analyze, consult widely | Cloud provider, core architecture, compliance standards |

- **Two-Way Doors:** Favor speed and experimentation. If it fails, you can easily reverse course.
- **One-Way Doors:** Require thorough analysis and broad alignment. Mistakes are costly or permanent.
- **Key Practice:** Always ask, "Is this a one-way or two-way door?"—then match your process to the risk.

## When to Apply
- When deciding how much process and analysis a decision needs
- When teams are moving too slowly on reversible decisions
- When teams are moving too quickly on irreversible decisions
- During prioritization to determine decision-making approach

## PM Example
Selecting a new analytics tool is a two-way door—you can switch tools later with some migration cost. Choosing your cloud provider or core architecture is a one-way door—switching later would be extremely costly. Match your decision process accordingly: quick experiments for two-way doors, thorough analysis for one-way doors.
