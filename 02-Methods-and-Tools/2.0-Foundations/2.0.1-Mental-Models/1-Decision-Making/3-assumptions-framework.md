# Assumptions Framework

## What It Is
A diagnostic for understanding the root cause of product disagreements by recognizing that when two people disagree about product strategy, they have different assumptions. The framework shifts focus from arguing solutions to aligning on underlying beliefs.

## How to Think With It
When disagreement occurs, pause solution discussion and ask "What assumptions lead each person to their preferred approach?" Map differences in beliefs about users, market, or technical constraints, then align or validate assumptions through data, research, or testing before revisiting solutions.

## Framework Structure

| Element | Description | Purpose |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Core Principle** | "When two people disagree about product strategy, they have different assumptions" | Shifts focus from arguing solutions to aligning on underlying beliefs |
| **Assumption Mapping** | Identify what each person believes to be true about users, market, or constraints | Surface hidden differences in worldview |
| **Shared Foundation** | Align on key assumptions before debating solutions | Create basis for genuine agreement and conviction |

## Process Flow
1. **When disagreement occurs**, pause solution discussion
2. **Ask "What assumptions"** lead each person to their preferred approach
3. **Map differences** in beliefs about users, market, technical constraints
4. **Align or validate** assumptions through data, research, or testing
5. **Revisit solutions** once assumptions are shared

## Application Patterns

| Scenario | Assumption Check | Resolution Path |
|----------|------------------|-----------------|
| **Top-Down Strategy** | "What assumptions led leadership to this direction?" | Understand reasoning before building roadmap |
| **Bottom-Up Proposals** | "What do I assume that others might not?" | Ensure stakeholders share your foundational beliefs |
| **Team Misalignment** | "What different assumptions explain our different views?" | Surface and reconcile conflicting worldviews |

## Key Benefits
- Transforms arguments into productive assumption discussions
- Builds genuine conviction rather than compliance
- Reveals when disagreement is actually about facts vs. opinions
- Creates pathway to passionate execution through shared beliefs

**Key Insight:** Passionate execution flows naturally from shared assumptions. Focus on aligning beliefs, not just agreeing on tasks.

## When to Apply
- When teams disagree about product strategy or direction
- When top-down strategy conflicts with bottom-up proposals
- When stakeholders seem to be talking past each other
- Before building roadmaps to ensure shared foundation

## PM Example
PM wants to build feature X, engineer wants feature Y. Instead of arguing features, ask: "What assumptions lead you to prefer X?" PM assumes users need quick wins; engineer assumes users need long-term value. Once assumptions are surfaced, you can validate which assumption is correct and align on the solution.
