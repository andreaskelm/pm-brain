## What It Is
A risk identification technique where you imagine a project has failed in the future and work backward to identify what went wrong, categorizing risks into Tigers (real threats), Paper Tigers (perceived but not dangerous), and Elephants (unspoken uncomfortable truths).

## How to Think With It
Instead of only planning for success, assume failure has occurred and ask "What went wrong?" This creates psychological safety to discuss potential failures and surfaces risks that might otherwise be ignored.

## Framework Structure

| Element | Type | Description | Purpose |
|---------|------|-------------|---------|
| **Initial Prompt** | Process | "Imagine this project has failed six months from now - what went wrong?" | Creates psychological safety to discuss potential failures |
| **Tigers** | Risk Category | Threats that will actually kill the project | Identify critical risks that must be mitigated |
| **Paper Tigers** | Risk Category | Seeming threats that aren't actually dangerous | Distinguish real vs. perceived risks |
| **Elephants** | Risk Category | Uncomfortable truths no one is discussing | Surface unspoken concerns and assumptions |

## Process Flow
1. **Gather team** early in project lifecycle
2. **Present failure scenario** using the prompt
3. **Categorize risks** into Tigers, Paper Tigers, Elephants
4. **Prioritize threats** voted on by team
5. **Create action plan** to address highest priority risks

## When to Apply
- Early in project lifecycle before major commitments
- When planning high-stakes initiatives or strategic pivots
- When teams seem overly optimistic or ignoring potential problems
- Before major launches or decisions with significant impact

## PM Example
Before launching a new feature, gather the team and ask: "Imagine this feature launched 6 months ago and completely failed—what went wrong?" Responses might include "Users didn't understand the value prop" (Tiger), "Competitors copied us" (Paper Tiger), or "We never validated that users actually wanted this" (Elephant). Prioritize addressing Tigers first.
