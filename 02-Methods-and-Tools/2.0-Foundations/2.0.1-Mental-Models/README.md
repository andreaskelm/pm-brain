# Mental Models

## Introduction

Mental models are quick-reference thinking tools for product managers. They complement process frameworks (2.1-2.10) and help with strategic thinking, team alignment, and navigating common product challenges.

**When to use mental models:**
- Strategic decision-making and prioritization
- Team alignment and conflict resolution
- Understanding different perspectives in product discussions
- Risk assessment and planning
- Matching decision speed to reversibility

**When process frameworks are better:**
- Structured workflows (discovery, validation, PRD writing)
- Step-by-step processes with templates
- Evidence-based research and validation
- Document creation and execution

## Structure

Mental models are organized by category:

### Decision-Making
- [Pre-mortems](1-Decision-Making/1-pre-mortems.md) - Risk identification by imagining failure
- [One-Way vs Two-Way Doors](1-Decision-Making/2-one-way-two-way-doors.md) - Matching decision speed to reversibility
- [Assumptions Framework](1-Decision-Making/3-assumptions-framework.md) - Understanding root causes of disagreements

- [Regret Minimization](1-Decision-Making/6-regret-minimization.md) - *TODO: fill content*

### Product-Thinking
- [Outcome vs Output](2-Product-Thinking/1-outcome-vs-output.md) - Distinguish outputs from outcomes

### Work-Levels
- [Tactical, Operational, Strategic Work Levels](3-Work-Levels/1-tactical-operational-strategic.md)
- [Three Levels of Product Work](3-Work-Levels/2-three-levels-of-work.md)
- [60-30-10 Framework](3-Work-Levels/3-sixty-thirty-ten.md) - Roadmap allocation (60% incrementals, 30% big bets, 10% infrastructure)

### Execution-Hygiene
- [Deep Work vs Shallow Work](4-Execution-Hygiene/1-deep-work-shallow-work.md) - *TODO: fill content*
- [Eisenhower Matrix](4-Execution-Hygiene/2-eisenhower-matrix.md) - *TODO: fill content*
- [LNO Framework](4-Execution-Hygiene/3-lno-framework.md) - *TODO: fill content*

### Team-Dynamics
- [Alignment Check](5-Team-Dynamics/1-alignment-check.md) - Diagnostic for hidden misalignment
- [Disagree and Commit](5-Team-Dynamics/2-disagree-and-commit.md) - *TODO: fill content*

- [Strong Opinions, Loosely Held](5-Team-Dynamics/4-strong-opinions-loosely-held.md) - *TODO: fill content*

### Product-Sense-Development
- [Start here: Product thinking](6-Product-Sense-Development/0-start-here-product-thinking.md) - Single entry point for product thinking: simple prompt to start, persona & background (for agent), situation → prompts → braindump → then framework; stuck → evaluation; AI, mental models, biases
- [Product Sense Development](6-Product-Sense-Development/README.md) - Systematic framework for developing product intuition through deliberate practice that acts as a cross-cutting lens on top of Strategy, Discovery, and Execution frameworks
- [Mental Models ↔ Product Sense Bridge](6-Product-Sense-Development/4-mental-models-product-sense-bridge.md) - When and how to use Decision-Making and Product-Thinking mental models during braindumps and product decisions
- [AI Product Sense](6-Product-Sense-Development/5-ai-product-sense.md) - Product sense for AI products (model capability, safety, trust)
- [Meta-Thinking for Product Sense](6-Product-Sense-Development/6-meta-thinking-for-product-sense.md) - Thinking modes, assumptions, and biases that affect product judgment

## How to Use Mental Models

1. **Strategic Planning**: Use 60-30-10 framework for roadmap allocation
2. **Risk Assessment**: Use Pre-mortems to identify project risks early
3. **Team Alignment**: Use Alignment Check and Assumptions Framework when teams disagree
4. **Decision Speed**: Use One-Way vs Two-Way Doors to match process to risk
5. **Stage Recognition**: Use 0-1 vs 1-100 to adapt team structure and metrics
6. **Product Sense Development**: Use Product Sense Development framework for systematic practice and growth tracking

## Format

Each mental model follows this structure:
- **What It Is** - 1-2 sentence description
- **How to Think With It** - The lens or frame this provides
- **When to Apply** - 3 situations where it's useful
- **PM Example** - Quick scenario showing it in action
- **Framework Structure** - Key elements and any core tables/process flows
- **Combines With** - Related frameworks/models
- **Further Reading** - Link to original source

## Template Alignment (when to expand beyond short format)
- Keep **short format only**: quick decision aids (Pre-mortems, One-Way vs Two-Way Doors, Alignment Check).
- Consider **Quickstart guide** if teams need a worked example: Outcome vs Output, Feature Factory.
- Consider **Full guide** if depth/nuance is needed: Four Risks of Product Management.
- Keep **Evaluation templates** optional unless quality gates are required.
