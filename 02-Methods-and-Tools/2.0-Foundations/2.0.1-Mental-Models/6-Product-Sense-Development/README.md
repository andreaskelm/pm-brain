## Product Sense Development

**Purpose:** Systematic framework for developing product intuition through deliberate practice.

This folder holds the **canonical theory, prompts, and templates**; day‑to‑day reps and logs live in `00-Meta/`. It underpins how you use every other framework in `02-Methods-and-Tools/`.

---

## Quick Start

1. **Read the framework** – [`1-product-sense-framework.md`](1-product-sense-framework.md) for philosophy and method.  
2. **Braindump before any framework** – use [`2-product-sense-prompts.md`](2-product-sense-prompts.md) and the global rule in [`PRODUCT-SENSE-RULES.md`](../../../../../PRODUCT-SENSE-RULES.md).  
3. **Do one 10‑minute rep** – pick an exercise from [`templates/1-daily-practice-exercises.md`](templates/1-daily-practice-exercises.md) and log it in `00-Meta/1-daily-log-YYYY-QX.md`.  
4. **Then open an execution framework** – e.g. OKRs, PRDs, Opportunity Assessment under `02-Methods-and-Tools/`.

## What’s in this folder

### Numbering in this folder

| Prefix | Meaning | Files |
|--------|--------|--------|
| **0-** | **Entry** (single file) | `0-start-here-product-thinking.md` — simple prompt to start, persona & background (for agent), navigation, workflow, frameworks by situation |
| **1–6** | **Framework content** | `1-product-sense-framework.md` … `6-meta-thinking-for-product-sense.md` |
| **templates/** | Practice and AI tools (1–6) | `1-daily-practice-exercises.md` … `6-pattern-recognition-log.md` |

### Entry (0-)

- **`0-start-here-product-thinking.md`** – single entry file; simple prompt to start, [persona & background for the agent](0-start-here-product-thinking.md#persona-and-background-for-agent), navigation map, workflow diagram, frameworks by situation. Referenced by AGENTS.md and product-sense rule.

### Core framework files (1–6)

In this folder we use **2-prompts** (not 2-template) because the content is **questions to drive thinking**, not a form to fill. Fill-in templates (PRD, OKR, etc.) live in `02-Methods-and-Tools/` (e.g. `2.3-Execution/2.3.4-PRD/2-prd-template.md`).

- **`1-product-sense-framework.md`** – full Product Sense development system  
- **`2-product-sense-prompts.md`** – braindump **prompts** (questions by situation) **before** any PM framework  
- **`3-product-sense-evaluation.md`** – decision diagnostic for when you’re stuck  

### Templates

Practice templates under `templates/`:

- **Daily practice:** [`1-daily-practice-exercises.md`](templates/1-daily-practice-exercises.md)  
- **Self‑assessment:** [`2-self-assessment-template.md`](templates/2-self-assessment-template.md)  
- **Weekly reflection:** [`3-weekly-reflection-template.md`](templates/3-weekly-reflection-template.md)  
- **Monthly synthesis:** [`4-monthly-synthesis-template.md`](templates/4-monthly-synthesis-template.md)
- **Adaptive AI prompts:** [`5-adaptive-ai-prompts.md`](templates/5-adaptive-ai-prompts.md) — copy-paste prompts for braindump, edge cases, second-order, strategy eval, bias detection, decision quality review, pattern recognition
- **Pattern recognition log:** [`6-pattern-recognition-log.md`](templates/6-pattern-recognition-log.md) — after-decision capture, weekly review, monthly synthesis

These are canonical practice tools; `00-Meta/` files should reference them rather than re‑implementing their structure.

## How the practice system works

```text
Daily Practice (10 min)
   ↓
Weekly Reflection (30 min)
   ↓
Monthly Synthesis (60 min)
   ↓
Growth Portfolio (evidence for reviews)
```

- **Daily (10 minutes)**  
  Pick ONE exercise from `templates/1-daily-practice-exercises.md` (observation, teardown, cross‑domain, pattern, judgment) and log 1–2 insights in `00-Meta/1-daily-log-YYYY-QX.md`.

- **Weekly (30 minutes)**  
  Copy `templates/3-weekly-reflection-template.md` into `00-Meta/0.1-Learning-Log/YYYY-QX/week-##.md`, then summarize decisions, patterns, and next‑week focus.

- **Monthly (60 minutes)**  
  Use `templates/4-monthly-synthesis-template.md` + `templates/2-self-assessment-template.md` to synthesize the month and update your self‑assessment; move 1–2 highlights into `00-Meta/0.2-Growth-Portfolio/`.

## How this bridges theory → practice → execution

This folder sits in the **Foundations** layer and feeds execution and initiatives:

1. **Think first (Product Sense)** – braindump with `2-product-sense-prompts.md`.  
2. **Structure second (Execution frameworks)** – pick the right tool under `02-Methods-and-Tools/` (PRD, OKR, roadmap, discovery, etc.).  
3. **Execute and reflect** – build under `04-Initiatives/`, then use `templates/` + `00-Meta/` logs to reflect and update your judgment.

## When to reach for Product Sense (vs other frameworks)

Use this framework when:

- You want to **deliberately improve product judgment**, not just ship a doc.  
- You’re about to make a **meaningful decision** (strategy, roadmap, PRD, big trade‑off).  
- You’re stuck, circling a decision, or feel your thinking is shallow.  
- You want **evidence of growth** for reviews or your own confidence.

You’ll typically pair this with other domains:

- **Strategy:** before/alongside OKRs, roadmaps, and North Star  
  - e.g. [`2.1-Strategy/2.1.2-Strategic-Execution/1-OKR/README.md`](../../../2.1-Strategy/2.1.2-Strategic-Execution/1-OKR/README.md)
- **Discovery:** before Opportunity Assessment, Research Interviews, JTBD, Idea Validation  
  - e.g. [`2.2-Discovery/2.2.4-Opportunity-Assessment/README.md`](../../../2.2-Discovery/2.2.4-Opportunity-Assessment/README.md)
- **Execution:** before PRDs, user stories, metrics work  
  - e.g. [`2.3-Execution/2.3.4-PRD/README.md`](../../../2.3-Execution/2.3.4-PRD/README.md)
- **Communication & reflection:** when writing one‑pagers or doing self‑reflection  
  - e.g. [`2.4-Communication/2.4.3-One-Pagers/README.md`](../../../2.4-Communication/2.4.3-One-Pagers/README.md), [`2.0-Foundations/2.0.3-Self-Reflection/README.md`](../2.0.3-Self-Reflection/README.md)

## Common pitfalls

- **Trying to do everything** – don’t run every exercise every week; pick one daily exercise and one weekly deep‑work block.  
- **Skipping the braindump** – jumping straight into templates produces checkbox thinking.  
- **Being too hard on yourself** – expect gradual improvement; be honest in self‑assessments, but don’t punish missed days.

Start with one braindump and one 10‑minute exercise. Everything else can grow from there.
