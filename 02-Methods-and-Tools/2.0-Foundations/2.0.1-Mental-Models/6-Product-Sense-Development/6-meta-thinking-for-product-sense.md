# Meta-Thinking for Product Sense

**Purpose:** Product sense isn't only *what* you think—it's *how* you think. Meta-thinking (thinking about your thinking) helps you notice modes, assumptions, and biases so you can improve judgment deliberately.

Use this alongside [2-product-sense-prompts.md](2-product-sense-prompts.md) and [PRODUCT-SENSE-RULES.md](../../../../../PRODUCT-SENSE-RULES.md). Before or after a braindump, check: Am I in the right mode? What am I assuming? What bias might be at play?

## Why Meta-Thinking Matters for Product Sense

- You can't improve what you can't observe. Meta-thinking makes your thinking visible so you can refine it.
- Product sense improves when you notice: Am I in product mode or project mode? Did I converge too early? Am I avoiding a hard truth?
- Decision *quality* (process) can be separated from *outcome* (result). Good meta-thinking improves quality; outcomes still involve luck.

## Five Thinking Modes

Recognize which mode you're in and switch when needed.

| Mode | When to use | Feels like | Trap |
|------|-------------|------------|------|
| **Divergent** | Early discovery, ideation, problem definition | Open, curious, "yes and…" | Stay too long → analysis paralysis |
| **Convergent** | Evaluating options, deciding, prioritizing | Critical, filtering, "this or that" | Start too early → miss better options |
| **Associative** | Seeing patterns, analogies, connections | "This reminds me of…" | False patterns, overgeneralizing |
| **Sequential** | Planning, ordering steps, organizing | Logical, "first this, then that" | Oversimplify complex systems |
| **Reflective** | After a decision or launch, learning | Stepping back, evaluating | Skip it → repeat same mistakes |

**Product sense link:** Before a braindump, ask: Do I need to generate more options (divergent) or narrow (convergent)? After a braindump, ask: Did I skip reflection on last time?

## Product vs. Project Thinking

From the golden rule and template—quick check:

- **Product thinking:** Why does this matter? Goals and outcomes. Second-order effects. How we differentiate. Long-term value.
- **Project thinking:** When is it due? Who does it? What else is like this? How we execute. Completion.

If you're about to fill a template and you're in project mode, switch to product mode first. Use the [thinking-mode nudge](2-product-sense-prompts.md) at the top of the prompts file.

## Information Gathering vs. Decision Avoidance

**Do I have enough information to decide?**

| State | Signs | Action |
|-------|--------|--------|
| **Not enough** | Guessing, no data, can't articulate reasoning | List 3 critical unknowns → go learn them. |
| **Just enough** | Can explain reasoning, identified unknowns, acceptable confidence | Decide + set a review point. |
| **Too much** | Diminishing returns, stalling, perfectionism | What am I afraid of? Decide anyway. |

**Self-check:** What would I need to know to decide with 80% confidence? Do I have that? If yes → decide. Can I learn it quickly (&lt;1 day)? If yes → learn then decide. If no → decide with current info + plan to learn more.

## Bias Detection (Real-Time)

Before or during a decision, ask: **Am I falling for a cognitive bias right now?**

Quick checks (antidotes in parentheses):

- **Confirmation bias:** Am I only seeking info that confirms my view? (Seek disconfirming evidence.)
- **Availability bias:** Am I overweighting a recent or memorable event? (Look at base rates.)
- **Anchoring:** Am I stuck on the first number or idea I heard? (Generate your own estimate first.)
- **Sunk cost:** Am I continuing because I've already invested? ("If I started fresh today, would I choose this?")
- **Optimism bias:** Am I underestimating time or difficulty? (2× your estimate, then explain why that's wrong.)

**Full list and debiasing strategies:** [2.0.2-Bias/1-bias-framework.md](../../2.0.2-Bias/1-bias-framework.md). Red flags in [2-product-sense-prompts.md](2-product-sense-prompts.md) often map to these biases.

## Assumption Recognition

**Skill:** Notice when you're assuming something and test it.

### Common PM Assumptions (Often Wrong)

- **About users:** "Users will understand this." "Users want more features." "Users are like me." "Users read the instructions."
- **About product:** "We just need to ship." "This edge case is rare." "Users will adapt." "The solution is obvious."
- **About process:** "This framework always works." "We need consensus." "More data will make this clearer." "We can't ship without X."

### Practice: Assumption Surfacing

Before a major decision:

1. Write down your recommendation.
2. List 5–10 assumptions you're making.
3. For each: How do I know? What would falsify it? How could I test it quickly?
4. Which assumptions are critical? Test those before deciding.

Use this in braindumps: the template's "What assumptions am I making? What don't I actually know yet?" is the same habit.

## Cognitive Biases That Hurt Product Sense

**Canonical source:** For the full list of biases, definitions, debiasing strategies, and checklists, see [2.0.2-Bias/1-bias-framework.md](../../2.0.2-Bias/1-bias-framework.md). That is the single place to update bias content.

The biases most relevant to product sense (confirmation, anchoring, sunk cost, availability, optimism, loss aversion, plus social and time biases) are covered there with PM examples and decision checklists.

**Product sense link:** Red flags in [2-product-sense-prompts.md](2-product-sense-prompts.md) often map to these biases (e.g. "prioritizing based on who shouted loudest" → availability/anchoring). Use the prompts file's red flags as a quick bias check; use the [Bias framework](../../2.0.2-Bias/1-bias-framework.md) for full definitions and debiasing strategies.

## Decision Quality vs. Outcome

- **Decision quality:** Did I use a good process? Did I consider the right things? Did I avoid obvious biases?
- **Outcome:** Did it work? Luck and external factors affect outcomes.

You can make a high-quality decision and get a bad outcome, or a low-quality decision and get a good outcome. Meta-thinking improves *quality*. Track both: "Was my process sound?" and "What happened?" so you don't over-fit to outcomes.

## When to Use This Doc

- **Before a braindump:** Am I in product mode? Do I need divergent or convergent thinking?
- **During/after a braindump:** What am I assuming? Which red flags or biases might apply?
- **After a decision:** Did I skip reflection? What would I do differently next time?
- **When stuck:** Am I avoiding the call? Overthinking? Waiting for permission I don't need? (See [3-product-sense-evaluation.md](3-product-sense-evaluation.md).)
