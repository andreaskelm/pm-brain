# Braindump Prompts - Think Before You Structure

**Purpose:** Help you think deeply *before* jumping into frameworks, so artifacts reflect real judgment instead of shallow, filled‑in boxes.

**Mindset:** You are a product sense coach for your future self—capture honest thinking, not polished prose.

**How to use:**

1. Pick the scenario that matches your situation
1. Write/speak your answers without editing (voice memos work great)
1. Don't worry about structure or completeness
1. THEN open the relevant framework/template
1. Use your braindump to inform structured thinking

You do **not** need to answer every question below. A small set of simple prompts, used consistently, does most of the work.

### Always-Ask Core Prompts

Before you dive into any specific section, quickly run through these:

- Who is this really for, and what is their day like?
- What job is this doing for them?
- What assumptions am I making? What don’t I actually know yet?
- If this works, what second-order effects might it create later—for users, the product, the team, or the business?
- What could go wrong, and what would I do if it did?

## Before Writing a PRD

### User Understanding

- Who is this really for? Not the persona - the actual human. What's their day like?
- What are they currently doing instead? Why does that suck for them?
- What have they told us they want? What do they actually need? (Often different)
- If this works, what changes in their day? What doesn't change?
- Who will hate this feature? Why?

### Problem Clarity

- What's the job they're hiring this feature to do?
- Why hasn't this been solved already? (Market gap? Technical limitation? Wrong priority?)
- What's the simplest possible version that would still be useful?
- What assumptions am I making about how they'll use this?
- What could go catastrophically wrong?
- If this feature really works, what second-order effects might it create for users, our product surface area, or our team 6–12 months from now?
- If this fails or gets half-adopted, what becomes harder or messier later?

### Business Reality

- Why this, why now?
- What happens if we don't build this?
- What metrics actually change if this succeeds?
- Who internally cares most about this? Why?
- What will we stop doing to make time for this?

-----

## Before Making a Prioritization Decision

### Opportunity Assessment

- What evidence do I have this matters? (Real data, not vibes)
- How many users does this affect? How deeply?
- What's my confidence level? (Wild guess? Educated? Very confident?)
- What would make me 10x more confident?
- Am I falling in love with my solution vs. the problem?

### Tradeoff Thinking

- What are we NOT doing if we do this?
- What's the opportunity cost?
- Is this reversible? If yes, bias toward action. If no, what don't we know?
- Does this make other things easier or harder?
- What do I wish we knew that we don't?
- If we say yes to this, what doors does it open or close for us later (for users, teams, roadmap options)?

### Organizational Reality

- Who needs to believe in this for it to succeed?
- What's the internal political reality?
- Do we have the right team/skills to execute this?
- What dependencies am I hand-waving away?

-----

## Before a Product Strategy Session

### Current State

- What's actually working? (Be honest)
- What's definitely not working? (Be honest)
- What do we keep saying we'll do but never do? Why?
- What's changed in the last 3-6 months that we're not talking about?

### Future Vision

- If everything goes right, what does success look like in 2 years?
- What would have to be true for that to happen?
- What are we uniquely positioned to do?
- What are we deluding ourselves about?
- If this strategy works, what second-order effects will it create across users, org, and product over time?

### Market & Competition

- What's our actual sustainable advantage? (Not marketing fluff)
- Who's solving this better than us? How?
- What trends are we riding? Which ones are we fighting?
- Where is the market going that we're not ready for?

-----

## Before User Research / Discovery

### What We Don't Know

- What question keeps me up at night about our users?
- What assumption, if wrong, would completely change our plans?
- What do I think I know that I'm not actually sure about?
- What evidence would change my mind?

### Curiosity Check

- What would surprise me to learn?
- What would I be disappointed to discover?
- What am I hoping NOT to hear? (Red flag - investigate this)
- If I learned one thing that changed everything, what would it be?

### Past Patterns

- What did we learn last time that we ignored?
- What user feedback keeps coming up that we haven't acted on?
- When have we been most wrong about users before?

-----

## When You're Stuck on a Product Decision

### Uncertainty Type

- Am I stuck because:
- I don't understand the user need well enough?
- I don't know if it's technically feasible?
- I don't know if it aligns with strategy?
- I don't know how to prioritize it?
- I'm worried about organizational pushback?
- I don't know what success looks like?
- Am I actually missing information, or am I uncomfortable making a call in ambiguity?

### Missing Information

- What's the ONE thing that, if I knew it, would make this easy?
- Can I get that information? How? How long would it take?
- Is this decision reversible? If yes, just try something.
- What's the cheapest way to reduce uncertainty?

### Decision Quality

- Am I overthinking this because it's actually low-stakes?
- Am I underthinking this because I'm avoiding hard truths?
- What would [person I respect] ask me right now?
- What am I afraid of?
- What will likely still be unknown no matter how much research I do, and how will I choose to move anyway?

## Before a Product Teardown

### Initial Impressions

- What's my gut reaction to this product? Why?
- What did I notice first? What did I ignore?
- What emotion does this product evoke?
- Would I recommend this to a friend? Why/why not?

### Hypothesis Formation

- Who do I think this is for?
- What job is it trying to do?
- What's the business model? (How do they make money?)
- What design decisions seem odd? (Often intentional - dig in)

### Questions to Investigate

- What's NOT here that I expected?
- What IS here that surprises me?
- What would I do differently? Why? (Be specific)
- What can I steal for my own products?

-----

## Before Talking to Stakeholders

### Their Perspective

- What do they care about that I don't?
- What pressures are they under?
- What does success look like from their seat?
- What am I asking them to risk?

### Your Ask

- What do I actually need from them?
- What's the minimum viable version of what I need?
- What's in it for them?
- What objections do I expect? How will I address them?

### Relationship Reality

- Do they trust me? If not, why not?
- Have I delivered for them before?
- What's the history I'm not accounting for?
- Who influences them that I should talk to first?

-----

## For AI Product Decisions

### Model Capabilities

- Can the current model even do this reliably?
- Am I designing for capabilities that don't exist yet?
- What happens when the model fails? (It will)
- How will users know when to trust vs. verify the output?

### Probabilistic Thinking

- This isn't deterministic - what's the accuracy range I need?
- What's the cost of false positives vs. false negatives?
- How do I handle edge cases without destroying UX?
- What does "good enough" look like here?
- If this succeeds, how might it change user behavior and expectations over time (second-order effects)?

### Safety & Ethics

- What could go wrong if this works perfectly?
- What biases might be lurking in the training data?
- Who could be harmed by this?
- What's my mitigation plan for hallucinations/mistakes?

### Human-AI Collaboration

- Where do I want the AI to decide vs. suggest vs. assist?
- How do I keep the human in control?
- What context does the AI need that it won't have?
- How do I build trust without over-trusting?

## Meta-Prompt: When You Don't Know Which Prompts to Use

Ask yourself:

1. What decision am I trying to make?
1. What's blocking me from making it?
1. Is it knowledge gap, uncertainty, complexity, or fear?
1. What type of thinking would help most right now?

Then pick the relevant section above.

## Remember

These prompts are conversation starters, not a checklist. Skip what feels irrelevant; lean into what feels uncomfortable. Your braindump doesn't need to be pretty—only honest.
