# Decision Diagnostic - When You're Stuck

**Purpose:** Identify what's blocking you and what type of thinking you need to move forward.

Use this **after** you’ve done a quick braindump with the relevant section of `2-product-sense-prompts.md` (Product Sense prompts). First let your intuition and raw thinking surface what feels off; then use this diagnostic to name the block type and choose an unsticking technique.

**When to use:**

- You've been circling on a decision for days
- You feel paralyzed by options
- You "know" the answer but can't articulate why
- Stakeholders are waiting and you're not sure what to tell them
- You have analysis paralysis

**How to use:**

1. Answer the diagnostic questions honestly
1. Identify your block type
1. Use the recommended unsticking technique
1. Set a decision deadline (even if imperfect)

## Step 2: Diagnostic Questions

Answer these quickly. First thought, not perfect thought.

### About the Decision

**What exactly am I trying to decide?**

- [One sentence. If you can't state it in one sentence, the decision is poorly framed.]

**Why does this decision matter?**

- [What changes if I decide A vs. B vs. C?]

**What happens if I don't decide?**

- [Be specific. "Nothing" is never true.]

**Is this decision reversible?**

- [ ] Fully reversible (can undo cheaply)
- [ ] Partially reversible (can change but with cost)
- [ ] Mostly irreversible (stuck with it)
- [ ] Completely irreversible (can't undo)

**If reversible, why haven't I just tried something?**

- [Your honest answer]

### About the Information

**What's the ONE thing that, if I knew it, would make this easy?**

- [Be specific]

**Can I get that information? How? How long would it take?**

- [ ] Yes, in hours: [how?]
- [ ] Yes, in days: [how?]
- [ ] Yes, in weeks: [how?]
- [ ] No, fundamentally unknowable

**What am I pretending to know that I don't actually know?**

- [Your honest answer. This is uncomfortable.]

**What evidence would change my mind?**

- [If you can't answer this, you're not really deciding—you've already decided and are justifying.]

### About the Tradeoffs

**What are the real options?**

- Option A: [describe]
- Option B: [describe]
- Option C: [describe]
- Option D: Do nothing [describe impact]

**What does each option optimize for?**

- Option A optimizes: [what goal?]
- Option B optimizes: [what goal?]
- Option C optimizes: [what goal?]

**What am I willing to sacrifice?**

- [ ] Time to market
- [ ] Quality/polish
- [ ] User delight
- [ ] Revenue/business impact
- [ ] Technical excellence
- [ ] Team morale
- [ ] Strategic alignment
- [ ] Political capital
- [ ] Other: [what?]

**What am I NOT willing to sacrifice?**

- [List non-negotiables]

### About Your Confidence

**What's my gut telling me?**

- [Don't rationalize. What does your instinct say?]

**Why don't I trust my gut on this?**

- [ ] Past decisions that went badly
- [ ] Stakeholder pressure
- [ ] Imposter syndrome
- [ ] This is outside my expertise
- [ ] The data contradicts my gut
- [ ] Other: [what?]

**If I had to decide RIGHT NOW, what would I choose?**

- [Force yourself to answer]

**What's my confidence level in that choice?**

- [ ] 0-20% (total guess)
- [ ] 20-40% (weak signal)
- [ ] 40-60% (uncertain)
- [ ] 60-80% (moderately confident)
- [ ] 80-100% (very confident)

**If I'm >60% confident, why haven't I decided yet?**

- [Your honest answer]

-----

## Step 3: Unsticking Techniques by Block Type

### If You Have Information Gaps

**Technique: Minimum Viable Information**

Ask yourself:

- What's the *minimum* information I need to get to 60% confidence?
- Can I get that in 1-2 days?
- If yes, do that. If no, decide with what you have.

**Framework to use:**

1. List assumptions you're making
1. Rank by: (a) how critical, (b) how uncertain
1. Test the top 1-2 assumptions only
1. Decide with those results

**Set a deadline:**

- Information gathering deadline: [date/time]
- Decision deadline: [date/time, max 2 days after info deadline]

### If You Face Uncertainty & Risk

**Technique: Risk Mitigation Planning**

Instead of avoiding risk, plan for it:

**For each option, ask:**

- What's the worst realistic outcome?
- How would I know if it's going badly?
- What would I do if that happens?
- Can I recover from it?

**Risk Matrix:**

```
Option A:
- Worst case: [what happens]
- Early warning signs: [how I'd detect]
- Mitigation plan: [what I'd do]
- Recoverable? [yes/no]

Option B:
[Same format]
```

**If reversible:** Bias toward action. Try something, set review date.

**If irreversible:** Do more homework, but set hard deadline to decide anyway.

**Set a deadline:**

- Risk analysis complete: [date/time]
- Decision deadline: [date/time]

### If You Face Complexity & Ambiguity

**Technique: Simplification Through Constraints**

Complexity often means you're trying to optimize too many things.

**Constraint forcing:**

- If I could only optimize for ONE thing, what would it be?
- If I had 1/10th the time, what would I cut?
- If I had to explain this to a 10-year-old, what's the core decision?

**Perspective shift:**

- What would [person I respect] do here?
- What would 1-year-from-now me wish I had decided?
- What would I tell a friend to do?

**Framework to use:**

1. State the decision in the simplest possible terms
1. Identify the ONE metric that matters most
1. Optimize for that, accept tradeoffs elsewhere
1. Decide

**Set a deadline:**

- Simplification exercise: [today]
- Decision deadline: [tomorrow]

### If You Face Organizational Politics

**Technique: Alignment & Escalation**

Political blocks require different tactics than product blocks.

**Alignment path:**

1. Who are the actual decision-makers? (Not who should be—who actually are)
1. What does each person optimize for?
1. Is there a frame where multiple stakeholders win?
1. If yes, pitch that frame
1. If no, escalate

**Escalation script:**

```
"I've analyzed this decision from [X perspectives].
Here are the options: [A, B, C].
I recommend [option] because [reasoning].
The tradeoff is [what we sacrifice].
I need a decision by [date] to proceed.
Can you help me move this forward or should I escalate to [person]?"
```

**Set a deadline:**

- Alignment conversations: [date]
- Escalation if not aligned: [date]
- Hard decision deadline: [date]

### If You Have Internal Blocks

**Technique: Emotional Honesty**

This is the hardest one. Time for brutal truth.

**Ask yourself:**

- What am I actually afraid of?
- Am I avoiding this decision because it's hard or because it's wrong?
- Am I overthinking to avoid accountability?
- What would I decide if I knew I couldn't fail?
- What would I decide if no one was watching?

**If you're overthinking:**

- Set timer for 5 minutes
- Write down your choice
- Write 3 bullet points why
- Send it to someone
- You've now committed (external accountability)

**If you're emotionally attached:**

- Acknowledge it: "I want option A because [emotional reason]"
- Ask: "Is that a good reason or just my preference?"
- Separate: "What would I choose if I didn't feel this way?"
- Decide based on that

**Set a deadline:**

- Self-reflection: [today, 30 minutes max]
- Decision deadline: [today or tomorrow]

-----

## Step 4: Decision-Making Framework

Once you've identified your block and used the unsticking technique, use this to actually decide:

### The "Good Enough" Decision Framework

**You don't need the perfect decision. You need a good-enough decision now.**

Ask yourself:

1. **Will this get us closer to the goal?** [Yes/No]
1. **Can we learn from this quickly?** [Yes/No]
1. **Can we recover if we're wrong?** [Yes/No]

**If 2 out of 3 are "Yes":** Make the call and move forward.

**If 0-1 are "Yes":** You need more information or a different frame.

### The "Regret Minimization" Framework

Ask yourself:

- 1 year from now, which option would I regret NOT trying?
- Which failure would I be okay with (learned something)?
- Which failure would I NOT be okay with (negligent)?

Choose the option that minimizes future regret while avoiding negligent failure.

### The "Two-Way Door" vs "One-Way Door" Framework

**Two-way door (reversible):**

- Make decision fast (hours/days)
- Bias toward action
- Set review date to course-correct
- Example: Feature experiment, UI change, pricing test

**One-way door (irreversible):**

- Take more time (days/weeks, but SET A LIMIT)
- Gather critical information only
- Get stakeholder alignment
- Document reasoning for future reference
- Example: Platform choice, major rewrite, strategic partnership

**Most decisions are two-way doors disguised as one-way doors.**

-----

## Step 5: Document & Commit

**Write this down:**

```
DECISION LOG - [Date]

Decision: [One sentence]

Context: [Why this decision matters]

Options considered:
- A: [brief]
- B: [brief]
- C: [brief]

Chosen: [Option X]

Reasoning:
- [Why this option]
- [Key tradeoff accepted]
- [Main assumption]

Confidence: [X%]

If I'm wrong, I'll know because: [Early warning signs]

Review date: [When I'll check if this was right]

Reversibility: [Can I undo this? How?]

Next actions:
- [ ] [First step]
- [ ] [Second step]
```

**Share this with:**

- [ ] My manager
- [ ] Key stakeholders
- [ ] My team
- [ ] Just myself (sometimes that's okay)

-----

## Emergency Techniques: When You're REALLY Stuck

### The "Phone a Friend" Technique

Call someone whose judgment you trust. Explain the decision in 2 minutes. Listen to their questions, not their answer. Their questions usually reveal what you're missing.

### The "Coin Flip" Technique

Literally flip a coin. Notice your emotional reaction:

- Relieved? That's your answer.
- Disappointed? Choose the other option.
- Neutral? The decision doesn't matter as much as you think—pick one and move on.

### The "Write the Email" Technique

Draft the email announcing your decision. Both versions. The one that's easier to write is probably the right choice. The one that requires more justification might be the wrong one.

### The "Sleep On It" Technique

If you have time, sleep on it. But SET A DEADLINE for after you wake up. "Sleep on it indefinitely" = procrastination.

-----

## Red Flags: When NOT to Decide Yet

Stop and escalate if:

- [ ] This violates company values or ethics
- [ ] This could harm users in irreversible ways
- [ ] This commits resources you don't control
- [ ] This decision belongs to someone else (you're overstepping)
- [ ] You have critical information arriving in <48 hours
- [ ] Your gut is SCREAMING that something is wrong (investigate that)

In these cases, pause and get help.

-----

## Accountability Mechanisms

**Set deadlines:**

- Decision deadline: [Date/time - MUST be specific]
- If I haven't decided by then, default action is: [What happens]

**Create forcing functions:**

- [ ] Tell someone I'll decide by [date]
- [ ] Schedule meeting to announce decision on [date]
- [ ] Set calendar reminder with: "DECIDE NOW OR ESCALATE"
- [ ] Make decision prerequisite for something else I care about

**Track your decision-making:**

- How long did this take? [Duration]
- How confident was I? [%]
- 30 days later, was I right? [Check]
- 90 days later, does it matter? [Check]

-----

## Remember

**Deciding is better than not deciding.**

An okay decision now beats a perfect decision next month.

You can course-correct later. You can't course-correct if you never start.

**Your job is to make the best decision you can with the information available, in the time you have.**

Perfect information doesn't exist. Perfect decisions don't exist.

**Good decisions + fast execution > Perfect decisions + slow execution.**
