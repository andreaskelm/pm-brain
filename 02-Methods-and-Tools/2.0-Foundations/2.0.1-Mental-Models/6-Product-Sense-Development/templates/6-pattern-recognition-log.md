# Pattern Recognition Log

**Purpose:** Turn experience into repeatable judgment by capturing patterns after decisions. Use this to build intuition over time and spot recurring blind spots.

**When to use:** After any non-trivial product decision (5 min). Optionally: weekly review (15 min), monthly synthesis (30 min). See [6-Product-Sense-Development README](../README.md) and [00-Meta/0.1-Learning-Log](../../../../../00-Meta/0.1-Learning-Log/) for how this fits with daily log and learning log.

## After Any Decision (5 min)

**Decision made:** [Brief description]

**Pattern identified:**
- What type of situation was this?
- Have I seen this pattern before? What category does it belong to?
- What was the key indicator?

**Mental model used:**
- Which mental model was most useful? Why did it apply here?

**What I missed:**
- What did I not consider? What would I watch for next time? What surprised me?

**Confidence calibration:**
- How confident was I (0–100%)? Was I overconfident or underconfident?
- For tracking over time: [00-Meta/0.3-Product-Judgment-Test](../../../../../00-Meta/0.3-Product-Judgment-Test/) (forecast log + Brier score).

## Weekly Pattern Review (15 min)

**Recurring patterns this week:**

1. [Pattern]: Showed up [X] times. Context: [When/where]. What it reveals: [Insight]. Action for next time: [What to do.]
2. [Pattern]: …

**Mental models I relied on:** Most used: [Model] → [Why useful]. Underutilized: [Model] → [Should use more for X].

**Blind spots revealed:** What am I consistently missing? What pattern keeps surprising me?

## Monthly Pattern Synthesis (30 min)

**Top patterns (when they apply, what to do):**
1. [Pattern] → [When it applies] → [What to do]
2. …

**Patterns I over-apply:** [Pattern] → [Where it fails] → [When to avoid]

**New patterns to watch for:** [Pattern] → [Hypothesis] → [How to test]
