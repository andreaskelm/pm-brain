## Tips for Daily Logging

### Keep It Lightweight

- Don't aim for perfect prose
- Bullet points are fine
- Skip days when nothing significant happened
- It's okay to write "no practice today"

### What's Worth Logging?

**Do log:**
- Practice exercises you completed
- Key insights that changed your thinking
- Product decisions (especially uncertain ones)
- Patterns you're noticing
- Feedback that surprised you

**Don't need to log:**
- Routine work
- Meetings with no insights
- Administrative tasks
- Obvious decisions

### When to Log

**Best times:**
- End of workday (5 min)
- After significant decisions
- After practice exercises
- During lunch break

**Not ideal:**
- First thing in morning (too rushed)
- Late evening (you'll forget details)

### Start a New File Each Quarter

- `1-daily-log-2026-Q1.md`
- `1-daily-log-2026-Q2.md`
- `1-daily-log-2026-Q3.md`
- `1-daily-log-2026-Q4.md`

**Why quarterly?**
- Manageable file size
- Natural review cadence
- Aligns with performance cycles

-----

## Weekly Review Process

At end of week:

1. **Read through the week's entries** (5 min)
1. **Look for patterns:**
   - What decisions worked/didn't?
   - What practice was most valuable?
   - What themes emerged?
1. **Copy relevant insights to weekly reflection**
   - `00-Meta/0.1-Learning-Log/[Year]-Q[#]/week-[##].md`

Don't just accumulate daily logs. **Synthesize them weekly.**

-----

## Monthly Review Process

At end of month:

1. **Skim all daily logs for the month** (10 min)
1. **Identify top 3-5 insights**
1. **Track decision outcomes:**
   - Check "Review" dates
   - Were you right? Wrong? Why?
1. **Update monthly synthesis:**
   - `00-Meta/0.1-Learning-Log/[Year]-Q[#]/monthly-[month].md`
1. **Update self-assessment if relevant:**
   - `02-Methods-and-Tools/2.0-Foundations/2.0.1-Mental-Models/6-Product-Sense-Development/templates/2-self-assessment-template.md`

-----

## Git Strategy

### Personal Daily Logs (Ignored by Git)

Daily logs are **personal** and generally **not committed** to the repo.

**Why?**
- These are your private notes
- Too noisy for commit history
- Change frequently throughout the day

### What DOES Get Committed?

- Weekly reflections (synthesized insights)
- Monthly syntheses (patterns over time)
- Updated self-assessments
- Growth portfolio updates

**The pattern:**
- Daily logs → Personal
- Weekly/monthly synthesis → Shared (if you want)

-----

## Remember

**This is your thinking space. Keep it simple.**

5 minutes at end of day > perfect detailed logs you never maintain.

The goal isn't documentation. It's **noticing patterns in your thinking** so you can improve.

**Low friction. High signal. Regular review.**
