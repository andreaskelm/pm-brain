## The Four Core Dimensions

### 1. Customer Insight (Understanding Users)

**Rating: [1-5]**

**1 - Surface Level:** I understand what users say they want

**3 - Underlying Needs:** I can distinguish between stated wants and actual needs
**4 - Predictive:** I can anticipate needs users haven't articulated
**5 - Transformative:** I see opportunities that reframe how users think about their problems

**Evidence for my rating:**

## The Three Essential PM Senses (Shreyas Doshi Framework)

Rate yourself on **natural strength** and **current capability** separately:

### Product Sense

- **Natural Strength:** [1-5]
- **Current Capability:** [1-5]
- **Gap Analysis:** [What's the difference? What have you developed?]

### Execution Sense

- **Natural Strength:** [1-5]
- **Current Capability:** [1-5]
- **Gap Analysis:** [What's the difference? What have you developed?]

### Analytical Sense

- **Natural Strength:** [1-5]

- **Gap Analysis:** [What's the difference? What have you developed?]

**Which is your superpower?** [Product / Execution / Analytical]
**Which is your biggest weakness?** [Product / Execution / Analytical]
**How are you deliberately working on your weakness?** [Specific actions]

## Remember

**You can't improve what you don't measure. You can't measure what you're not honest about.**

This assessment is private. No one is grading you. Be brutally honest.

The goal isn't to get all 5s. The goal is to know where you are so you can get better.

**Growth happens when you confront uncomfortable truths, not when you inflate your self-perception.**
