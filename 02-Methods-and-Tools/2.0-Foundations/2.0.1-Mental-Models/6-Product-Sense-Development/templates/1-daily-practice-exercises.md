# Daily Practice Exercises (10-Minute Reps)

**Purpose:** Build product sense muscle through consistent, deliberate practice. These are reps, not projects.

**The 30/70 Rule:** Spend 30% consuming (reading), 70% doing (practicing). Even 10 minutes daily compounds.

**How to use:**

1. Pick ONE exercise per day
1. Set timer for 10 minutes
1. Do it, don't perfect it
1. Log key insights (1-2 sentences)
1. Rotate exercises to avoid getting stale

-----

## Exercise Categories

- **Observation** - Train yourself to notice what others miss
- **Teardown** - Analyze products systematically
- **Cross-Domain** - Steal ideas from other industries
- **Pattern Recognition** - Build your mental library
- **Judgment Training** - Practice making calls under uncertainty

## Tips for Consistency

**Make it stupid-easy:**

- Keep templates accessible (bookmark this file)
- Set calendar reminder: "10-min product sense practice"
- Log in a simple format (bullet points OK)
- Don't aim for perfection

**Avoid these traps:**

- ❌ Waiting for 30-minute blocks (10 min is fine!)
- ❌ Only practicing interview prep (this is a daily muscle)
- ❌ Doing the same exercise repeatedly (rotate to avoid stagnation)
- ❌ Not logging anything (you'll forget the insights)

**Track your streak:**

- [ ] Days practiced this week: ___
- [ ] Longest streak: ___
- [ ] What broke your streak: ___
- [ ] How to prevent that: ___

-----

## Remember

**10 minutes daily beats 2 hours monthly.**

Even a coffee break is enough for one observation or teardown.

The goal isn't perfect execution. The goal is **building the habit of thinking like a product person every single day.**

Consistency > Intensity.
