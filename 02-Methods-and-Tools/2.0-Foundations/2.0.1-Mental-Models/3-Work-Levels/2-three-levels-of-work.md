# Three Levels of Product Work

## What It Is
A framework recognizing three levels of product work: Impact (outcomes and business results), Execution (delivery and getting things done), and Optics (creating awareness and visibility). Each level has different focuses, typical roles, and potential issues.

## How to Think With It
Use shared vocabulary to identify which level each person is operating at, then align on what's most important for the current context. Conflicts often arise when people are operating at different levels—Impact vs Execution, Execution vs Optics, or Impact vs Optics.

## Framework Structure

| Level | Focus | Typical Roles | Common Activities | Potential Issues |
|-------|-------|---------------|-------------------|------------------|
| **Impact** | Outcomes, customer experience, business results | Executives, CEOs, founders | Strategy discussions, customer impact analysis, business metrics | May miss execution realities |
| **Execution** | Delivery, milestones, getting things done | PMs, engineers, designers | Sprint planning, task management, bug fixes, feature delivery | May lose sight of bigger picture |
| **Optics** | Creating awareness and visibility | All roles (necessary function) | Status updates, presentations, documentation, communication | Can become the goal instead of means |

## Conflict Patterns
- **Impact vs Execution**: CEO asks "Why is customer service poor?" PM explains resource constraints
- **Execution vs Optics**: Team focused on delivery vs. stakeholders wanting visibility
- **Impact vs Optics**: Results-focused leaders vs. perception-focused team members

## Resolution Strategy
Use shared vocabulary to identify which level each person is operating at, then align on what's most important for the current context.

## When to Apply
- When teams seem to be talking past each other
- When conflicts arise between different roles or stakeholders
- When execution teams feel disconnected from strategy
- When optics become the goal instead of a means

## PM Example
CEO asks "Why is customer service poor?" (Impact level). PM explains resource constraints and technical limitations (Execution level). Marketing wants more visibility into progress (Optics level). Using this framework helps identify the level mismatch and align on what matters most right now.
