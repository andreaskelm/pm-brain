# 60-30-10 Framework

## What It Is
A roadmap allocation framework that divides effort into 60% Incrementals (high-ROI improvements), 30% Big New Initiatives (major opportunities), and 10% Stability & Infrastructure (technical debt and foundational work).

## How to Think With It
Prevents roadmaps from being filled entirely with quick wins by ensuring dedicated time for high-impact opportunities. Forces prioritization of big initiatives since you can't do 5 major projects with only 30% allocation. Balances immediate needs with long-term strategic goals.

## Framework Structure

| Allocation | Focus Area | Description | Examples |
|------------|------------|-------------|----------|
| **60%** | **Incrementals** | High-ROI features that improve users' daily experience | Bug fixes, UI improvements, small feature enhancements, performance optimizations |
| **30%** | **Big New Initiatives** | Major opportunities that could significantly change trajectory (1-2 initiatives max) | New product lines, major feature launches, platform rewrites, strategic pivots |
| **10%** | **Stability & Infrastructure** | Technical debt and foundational work | Code refactoring, security updates, tooling improvements, monitoring systems |

## Key Benefits
- Prevents roadmap from being filled entirely with quick wins
- Ensures dedicated time for high-impact opportunities
- Balances immediate needs with long-term strategic goals
- Forces prioritization of big initiatives (can't do 5 with only 30% allocation)

## When to Apply
- When planning quarterly or annual roadmaps
- When roadmaps are dominated by small improvements
- When teams struggle to prioritize big initiatives
- When balancing short-term wins with strategic bets

## PM Example
A product team allocates 60% to bug fixes and small UX improvements, 30% to launching a new product line, and 10% to refactoring technical debt. This ensures they deliver value while also pursuing transformative opportunities and maintaining system health.
