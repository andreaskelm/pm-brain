# Tactical, Operational, Strategic Work Levels

**Mental model by:** Melissa Perri ("Escaping the Build Trap")
**What it is:** Framework for categorizing PM work by time horizon and impact

## What It Is
Three levels of PM work with different time horizons and focus areas.

## How to Think With It
Ask: "What level of work am I doing? What level SHOULD I be doing?"

## Framework Structure

### The Three Levels

| Level | Time Horizon | Focus | Example Activities |
|-------|--------------|-------|-------------------|
| **Tactical** | Days-Weeks | Execution | Writing stories, grooming backlog, answering questions |
| **Operational** | Months-Quarter | Delivery | Roadmap execution, feature delivery, sprint planning |
| **Strategic** | Quarters-Years | Direction | Strategy, vision, market analysis, big bets |

## Detailed Breakdown

### Tactical Work (Days to Weeks)
**What:** Day-to-day execution
**Activities:**
- Writing user stories
- Answering team questions
- Attending standups
- Reviewing designs
- Testing features

**Red flag:** Spending >50% of time here as senior PM

### Operational Work (Months to Quarter)
**What:** Delivering on roadmap
**Activities:**
- Managing roadmap
- Coordinating releases
- Sprint planning
- Stakeholder updates
- Feature launches

**Sweet spot:** Where most PMs spend most time

### Strategic Work (Quarters to Years)
**What:** Setting direction
**Activities:**
- Product strategy
- Market analysis
- Vision setting
- OKRs
- Portfolio planning

**Red flag:** Spending <20% of time here as senior PM

## When to Apply
- Evaluating how you spend time
- Leveling up PM responsibilities
- Diagnosing why you're always busy but not impactful
- Career development conversations

## PM Level Expectations

| PM Level | Tactical | Operational | Strategic |
|----------|----------|-------------|-----------|
| **Associate PM** | 60% | 35% | 5% |
| **PM** | 40% | 50% | 10% |
| **Senior PM** | 20% | 50% | 30% |
| **Principal/Staff** | 10% | 30% | 60% |
| **Head of Product** | 5% | 20% | 75% |

*These are guidelines, not rules*

## PM Example
**Too tactical:** Spending all day writing detailed user stories
**Balanced:** Writing strategy (strategic) → defining features (operational) → clarifying stories (tactical)

## Combines With
- Three Levels of Work (Shreyas Doshi - Impact/Execution/Optics)
- LNO Framework (Leverage/Neutral/Overhead)
- Time management frameworks

## Common Mistakes
- Senior PMs doing junior PM work
- Not delegating tactical work
- Avoiding strategic work (feels less urgent)
- All strategic, no execution (ivory tower)

## Self-Diagnosis
**Track your time for a week:**
- What % was tactical? Operational? Strategic?
- Does this match your level?
- What should you delegate or stop doing?
