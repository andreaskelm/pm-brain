# Stakeholder Management Framework

## Introduction

This framework helps product managers identify, prioritize, and effectively manage stakeholders in large organizations. Stakeholder management is NOT about politics—it's about ensuring the right people have the right information at the right time to make good decisions.

## How to Use This Framework

### Step 0: Braindump & Think First (Critical!)

**Before mapping stakeholders, braindump:**
- Who affects or is affected by your work? Dump everyone - don't filter yet.
- What does your product sense tell you? Who really matters?
- What assumptions are you making about relationships? List them.
- What biases might affect your stakeholder view? (Overvaluing some? Undervaluing others?)

**Product sense exercise:**
- If you had to get buy-in from ONE person, who would it be? Why?
- What would make you say "this stakeholder map is obviously wrong"?
- What would make you say "this stakeholder map is obviously right"?

### Step 1: Review Framework
Read `1-stakeholder-management-framework.md` to understand stakeholder management principles

### Step 2: Map Stakeholders
Use the stakeholder mapping guide to identify and assess all stakeholders

### Step 3: Create Engagement Plan

### Step 4: Set Up Tracking
Create a system to track interactions and relationships

### Step 5: Execute and Maintain

- What would you do differently?
