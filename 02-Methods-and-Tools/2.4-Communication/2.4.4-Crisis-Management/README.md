# Crisis Management Framework

## Introduction

This framework helps product teams and organizations prepare for, respond to, and recover from crises. Crisis management is NOT about preventing all problems—it's about responding effectively when the unexpected happens.

## How to Use This Framework

### Step 0: Braindump & Assess (Critical!)

**Use prompts from:** [2-product-sense-prompts.md](../../../../2.0-Foundations/2.0.1-Mental-Models/6-Product-Sense-Development/2-product-sense-prompts.md) → [When Something Goes Wrong (Crisis / Incident)](../../../../2.0-Foundations/2.0.1-Mental-Models/6-Product-Sense-Development/2-product-sense-prompts.md#when-something-goes-wrong-crisis--incident).

**Quick start:** What's happening? How serious is this really? What assumptions? What don't you know yet? What biases might affect your assessment? What would make you say "obviously a crisis" vs "just an incident"? **See prompts file for full list.**

### Step 1: Assess Severity
Use the severity criteria to determine if this is Level 1, 2, or 3

### Step 2: Activate Crisis Management Team
Notify appropriate CMT members based on severity

### Step 3: Follow Response Procedures
Execute immediate actions and follow the appropriate playbook

### Step 4: Communicate
Follow communication protocols for internal and external stakeholders

### Step 5: Recover
Implement recovery procedures once crisis is resolved

### Step 6: Learn
Conduct post-mortem and update crisis management plan
