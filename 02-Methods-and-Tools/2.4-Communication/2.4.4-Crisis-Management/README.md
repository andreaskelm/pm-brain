# Crisis Management Framework

## Introduction

This framework helps product teams and organizations prepare for, respond to, and recover from crises. Crisis management is NOT about preventing all problems—it's about responding effectively when the unexpected happens.

## How to Use This Framework

### Step 0: Braindump & Assess (Critical!)

**When a potential crisis emerges, braindump:**
- What's happening? Dump all facts - don't filter yet.
- What does your product sense tell you? How serious is this really?
- What assumptions are you making? What don't you know yet?
- What biases might affect your assessment? (Minimizing? Overreacting? Availability bias?)

**Product sense exercise:**
- If this were happening to a competitor, how would you assess it?
- What would make you say "this is obviously a crisis"?
- What would make you say "this is just an incident"?

### Step 1: Assess Severity
Use the severity criteria to determine if this is Level 1, 2, or 3

### Step 2: Activate Crisis Management Team
Notify appropriate CMT members based on severity

### Step 3: Follow Response Procedures
Execute immediate actions and follow the appropriate playbook

### Step 4: Communicate
Follow communication protocols for internal and external stakeholders

### Step 5: Recover
Implement recovery procedures once crisis is resolved

### Step 6: Learn
Conduct post-mortem and update crisis management plan
