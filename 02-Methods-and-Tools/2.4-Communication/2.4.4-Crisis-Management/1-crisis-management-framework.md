# Crisis Management Framework

## Overview

This framework helps product teams and organizations prepare for, respond to, and recover from crises. Crisis management is NOT about preventing all problems—it's about responding effectively when the unexpected happens.

## Step 0: Braindump & Assess (Critical!)

**Use prompts from:** [2-product-sense-prompts.md](../../../../2.0-Foundations/2.0.1-Mental-Models/6-Product-Sense-Development/2-product-sense-prompts.md) → [When Something Goes Wrong (Crisis / Incident)](../../../../2.0-Foundations/2.0.1-Mental-Models/6-Product-Sense-Development/2-product-sense-prompts.md#when-something-goes-wrong-crisis--incident). Quick start: What's happening? How serious? What assumptions? What don't you know? What biases? **See prompts file for full list.**

**Product sense exercise:**
- If this were happening to a competitor, how would you assess it?
- What would make you say "this is obviously a crisis"?
- What would make you say "this is just an incident"?

## Core Philosophy

### Crises are NOT Predictable

Effective crisis management should:

- **Enable rapid response over perfect planning** - Act decisively with imperfect information
- **Foster resilience over prevention** - Bounce back quickly when things go wrong
- **Drive learning over blame** - Improve systems, don’t punish people
- **Create clarity over chaos** - Provide structure when everything feels uncertain

### Understanding Crisis vs. Incident

**INCIDENT (Operational Issue)**

- Routine operational problem
- Handled by standard procedures
- Limited scope and impact
- Tactical response by operational teams

**CRISIS (Existential Threat)**

- Unexpected, high-impact event
- Threatens organization’s reputation or viability
- Wide-reaching consequences
- Strategic response by leadership

**Key Difference:** A crisis requires a whole-of-organization response and poses an existential threat to reputation, operations, or viability.

-----

## 🚨 Crisis Definition

**A crisis is:**

> An event with low probability of occurring but, if it does occur, has vastly negative impact on the organization. It threatens strategic objectives, reputation, and viability, and requires immediate response.

**Examples of Crises:**

- Major security breach exposing customer data
- Product defect causing harm or death
- Key leader misconduct/scandal
- Natural disaster disrupting operations
- Regulatory violation with legal consequences
- Major service outage affecting millions
- Supply chain collapse
- Public relations disaster going viral
- Financial fraud or bankruptcy threat

**Examples of Incidents (NOT Crises):**

- Bug affecting small user segment
- Brief service degradation (under 1 hour)
- Single customer complaint
- Minor security vulnerability
- Routine production issue

-----

## 📋 Crisis Management Framework Structure

### 1. Five Phases of Crisis Management

**Phase 1: ANTICIPATE** (Pre-Crisis)

- Identify potential threats
- Assess likelihood and impact
- Monitor warning signals

**Phase 2: PREPARE** (Pre-Crisis)

- Develop response plans
- Train crisis management team
- Conduct drills and simulations

**Phase 3: RESPOND** (During Crisis)

- Activate crisis management plan
- Make rapid decisions
- Execute response actions

**Phase 4: RECOVER** (Post-Crisis)

- Restore normal operations
- Implement business continuity
- Support affected stakeholders

**Phase 5: LEARN** (Post-Crisis)

- Conduct post-mortem analysis
- Document lessons learned
- Update plans and procedures

-----

## 🎯 Crisis Severity Levels

### Level 1: Minor Crisis (Yellow)

**Impact:** Single team/product, limited customer impact
**Response Time:** Within 4 hours
**Leadership:** Product/Team Lead
**Example:** Feature bug affecting 5% of users

**Response:**

- Product team handles with standard escalation
- Regular stakeholder updates
- Fix and monitor

-----

### Level 2: Major Crisis (Orange)

**Impact:** Multiple teams, significant customer impact
**Response Time:** Within 1 hour
**Leadership:** VP Product/Engineering
**Example:** Service degradation affecting 25% of users for 2+ hours

**Response:**

- Assemble incident response team
- Hourly executive updates
- Customer communication plan
- All-hands-on-deck until resolved

-----

### Level 3: Severe Crisis (Red)

**Impact:** Company-wide, existential threat
**Response Time:** Immediate (minutes)
**Leadership:** CEO + Crisis Management Team
**Example:** Major data breach, safety incident, public scandal

**Response:**

- Activate full Crisis Management Team (CMT)
- Establish command center
- Legal, PR, communications activated
- Board notification
- Potential media/regulatory response

-----

## 👥 Crisis Management Team (CMT)

## ⚠️ Crisis Management Anti-Patterns

### Anti-Pattern #1: “We Don’t Need a Plan”

**What it looks like:**

- “We’ll figure it out when something happens”
- No documented procedures
- No trained crisis team

**Why it’s harmful:**

- Chaos and confusion during actual crisis
- Slow response costs time and trust
- Legal/regulatory penalties

**Solution:**

- Create basic plan now (doesn’t need to be perfect)
- Identify crisis team
- Run one tabletop exercise
- Review and improve quarterly

-----

### Anti-Pattern #2: Hiding the Crisis

**What it looks like:**

- Delayed or no external communication
- Minimizing severity
- “It’s not that bad”

**Why it’s harmful:**

- Makes crisis worse when truth emerges
- Destroys trust permanently
- Legal liability increases

**Solution:**

- Communicate early, even with incomplete information
- Acknowledge what you don’t know
- Commit to updates
- Own the problem

-----

### Anti-Pattern #3: Playing the Blame Game

**What it looks like:**

- Looking for who to punish
- Defensive posture
- Protecting reputation over doing what’s right

**Why it’s harmful:**

- Delays resolution
- Creates culture of fear
- Misses systemic improvements

**Solution:**

- Focus on resolution, not blame
- Blameless post-mortems
- Fix systems, not people
- Learn and improve

-----

### Anti-Pattern #4: No One in Charge

**What it looks like:**

- Unclear decision-making authority
- Too many cooks
- Decision paralysis

**Why it’s harmful:**

- Delayed decisions make crisis worse
- Conflicting communications
- Wastes critical time

**Solution:**

- Designate Crisis Manager
- Clear escalation path
- Defined decision rights
- Single source of truth

-----

### Anti-Pattern #5: “The Crisis is Over” Too Soon

**What it looks like:**

- Declaring victory prematurely
- Disbanding team before recovery complete
- Skipping post-mortem

**Why it’s harmful:**

- Crisis can reignite
- Miss learning opportunities
- Don’t implement improvements

**Solution:**

- Formal recovery phase
