# Saying No Framework

## Introduction

This framework helps PMs decline requests gracefully without burning bridges. Saying no is a critical skill in large organizations where requests often exceed capacity.

## How to Use This Framework

### Step 0: Braindump & Assess (Critical!)

**Use prompts from:** [2-product-sense-prompts.md](../../../../2.0-Foundations/2.0.1-Mental-Models/6-Product-Sense-Development/2-product-sense-prompts.md) → [Before Saying No](../../../../2.0-Foundations/2.0.1-Mental-Models/6-Product-Sense-Development/2-product-sense-prompts.md#before-saying-no).

**Quick start:** What are they really asking for? Is there a yes hidden in this request? What's the real need behind the request? What biases might affect your response? If unlimited resources, would you say yes? **See prompts file for full list.**
- What would make you say "I can obviously find a way to say yes"?

### Step 1: Review Framework
Read `1-saying-no-framework.md` to understand principles and templates

### Step 2: Diagnose Request Type
Identify what type of request this is (Feature, Priority, Scope, Resource, Time)

### Step 3: Use Response Framework
Apply the three-part structure: Acknowledge, Explain, Offer

### Step 4: Choose Appropriate Template
Select the template that matches the request type and situation

### Step 5: Customize and Communicate
Adapt the template to your specific context and communicate clearly

### Step 6: Document and Follow Up
Document the decision and follow up if situation changes

## When to Use

- Feature requests that don't align with strategy
- Priority changes that conflict with commitments
- Scope creep during active development
- Resource requests you can't fulfill
- Meeting/time requests you can't accommodate

## How to Maintain

- **After Saying No**: Document in backlog with rationale
- **Regular Review**: Revisit deprioritized items quarterly
- **Relationship Building**: Maintain relationships even after saying no
