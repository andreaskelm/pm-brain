# Saying No Framework

## Introduction

This framework helps PMs decline requests gracefully without burning bridges. Saying no is a critical skill in large organizations where requests often exceed capacity.

## How to Use This Framework

### Step 0: Braindump & Assess (Critical!)

**Before saying no, braindump:**
- What are they really asking for? Dump your understanding - don't judge yet.
- What does your product sense tell you? Is there a yes hidden in this request?
- What assumptions are you making? What's the real need behind the request?
- What biases might affect your response? (People-pleasing? Avoiding conflict?)

**Product sense exercise:**
- If you had unlimited resources, would you say yes?
- What would make you say "I obviously need to say no"?
- What would make you say "I can obviously find a way to say yes"?

### Step 1: Review Framework
Read `1-saying-no-framework.md` to understand principles and templates

### Step 2: Diagnose Request Type
Identify what type of request this is (Feature, Priority, Scope, Resource, Time)

### Step 3: Use Response Framework
Apply the three-part structure: Acknowledge, Explain, Offer

### Step 4: Choose Appropriate Template
Select the template that matches the request type and situation

### Step 5: Customize and Communicate
Adapt the template to your specific context and communicate clearly

### Step 6: Document and Follow Up
Document the decision and follow up if situation changes

## When to Use

- Feature requests that don't align with strategy
- Priority changes that conflict with commitments
- Scope creep during active development
- Resource requests you can't fulfill
- Meeting/time requests you can't accommodate

## How to Maintain

- **After Saying No**: Document in backlog with rationale
- **Regular Review**: Revisit deprioritized items quarterly
- **Relationship Building**: Maintain relationships even after saying no
