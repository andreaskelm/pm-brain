# 2.4 – Communication Methods Overview

This domain contains methods and templates for keeping stakeholders informed, aligned, and trained. Use these frameworks when you need to communicate effectively, manage relationships, handle crises, or create training materials.

**Who this is for / when you're here**
- **Junior PMs:** Learn structured approaches to stakeholder communication, saying no gracefully, and running effective meetings. Start with Meeting Agendas and Stakeholder Management.
- **Senior PMs:** Quick reference for crisis management, escalation frameworks, and course design. Navigate directly to specific frameworks as needed.

## Before using anything here (recommended)
- Braindump: What are you trying to communicate? Who needs to know? Dump everything first.
- Product sense: What feels right/wrong about this communication need? What's the core message?
- Bias check: What biases might be affecting you? (Confirmation bias, solution bias, people-pleasing bias)
- Reflection: What would make this communication obviously effective or ineffective?

## How this is organized

- `2.4.1-Newsletter/` — Framework and template for recurring stakeholder updates (e.g. monthly or weekly product newsletters). **Use when:** You need consistent, scalable comms about progress, risks, and decisions.

- `2.4.2-Meeting-Agendas/` — Agenda templates and frameworks for sprint reviews, retrospectives, planning sessions, stakeholder readouts, and other common PM meetings. **Use when:** You need to run effective meetings that drive decisions.

- `2.4.3-One-Pagers/` — Framework and templates for narrative one-pagers and lightweight briefs. **Use when:** You need to align leadership and teams on proposals, decisions, and strategy.

- `2.4.4-Crisis-Management/` — Comms playbooks and templates for when things go wrong (incidents, outages, serious bugs). **Use when:** You need to communicate quickly and clearly during high-pressure situations.

- `2.4.5-Escalation/` — Framework for knowing when and how to escalate issues in large organizations. **Use when:** You need to navigate authority, resources, and decision-making effectively.

- `2.4.6-Saying-No/` — Framework for declining requests gracefully without burning bridges. **Use when:** Capacity is limited and you need to say no professionally.

- `2.4.7-Stakeholder-Management/` — Framework for identifying, prioritizing, and managing stakeholders. Includes mapping, managing up, and cross-functional alignment guides. **Use when:** You need to build relationships and ensure the right people have the right information.

- `2.4.9-Courses/` — Course design framework and template. **Use when:** You need to structure internal enablement, PM onboarding, or external training materials in a repeatable way.

## Typical flows

```
Stakeholder-Management → Newsletter → Meeting-Agendas → One-Pagers
                                                          ↓
Crisis-Management ← Escalation ← Saying-No ← (conflict/request)
                                                          ↓
Courses (for training and enablement)
```

## Maintenance notes
- Keep "How this is organized" and "When to use what" current.
- Update flows when frameworks are added/removed.
- Add/remove "Before using…" prompts if the domain needs them.
- Note: 2.4.8 is intentionally skipped (reserved for future framework if needed).
