# Newsletter Framework

## Introduction

Use these templates and guidelines to produce monthly, stakeholder-friendly newsletters quickly and consistently. Newsletters communicate progress on OKRs, roadmap initiatives, and key decisions to stakeholders across the organization.

**When to use newsletters:**
- Monthly stakeholder communication
- Sharing progress on OKRs and initiatives
- Communicating key decisions and learnings
- Building alignment across teams

**When newsletters might not be needed:**
- Very small teams with direct communication
- Projects with no external stakeholders
- Exploratory work before clear progress emerges
