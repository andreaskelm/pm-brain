# Escalation Framework

## Introduction

This framework helps PMs navigate when to escalate issues in large organizations. Escalation is a critical skill that junior PMs often struggle with—knowing when to handle something yourself vs. involve leadership.

## How to Use This Framework

### Step 0: Braindump & Assess (Critical!)

**Use prompts from:** [2-product-sense-prompts.md](../../../../2.0-Foundations/2.0.1-Mental-Models/6-Product-Sense-Development/2-product-sense-prompts.md) → [Before Escalation](../../../../2.0-Foundations/2.0.1-Mental-Models/6-Product-Sense-Development/2-product-sense-prompts.md#before-escalation).

**Quick start:** What's the issue? Can you handle this? What assumptions? What have you tried? What biases might affect your decision? If full authority, what would you do? What would make you say "obviously need to escalate" vs "obviously handle myself"? **See prompts file for full list.**

### Step 1: Review Framework
Read `1-escalation-framework.md` to understand when and how to escalate

### Step 2: Use Decision Tree
Work through the escalation decision tree to determine if escalation is needed

### Step 3: Try Self-Resolution First
Complete the self-checklist before escalating

### Step 4: Use Communication Templates
Follow the SIOR framework and use scenario-specific templates

### Step 5: Follow Up
Track the escalation and follow up if needed

### Step 6: Document and Learn
Document the outcome and learn for future similar situations

## When to Use

- Cross-team conflicts you can't resolve
- Technical feasibility questions requiring leadership input
- Resource/budget needs beyond your authority
- Scope/priority changes conflicting with commitments
- Decisions requiring executive authority

## How to Maintain

- **After Each Escalation**: Document outcome and learnings
- **Quarterly Review**: Review escalation patterns and improve processes
- **Regular Training**: Practice escalation scenarios with team
