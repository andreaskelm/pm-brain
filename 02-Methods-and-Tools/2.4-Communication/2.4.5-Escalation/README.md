# Escalation Framework

## Introduction

This framework helps PMs navigate when to escalate issues in large organizations. Escalation is a critical skill that junior PMs often struggle with—knowing when to handle something yourself vs. involve leadership.

## How to Use This Framework

### Step 0: Braindump & Assess (Critical!)

**Before escalating, braindump:**
- What's the issue? Dump everything you know - don't structure yet.
- What does your product sense tell you? Can you handle this?
- What assumptions are you making? What have you tried?
- What biases might affect your decision? (Escalating too quickly? Avoiding escalation?)

**Product sense exercise:**
- If you had full authority, what would you do?
- What would make you say "I obviously need to escalate this"?
- What would make you say "I can obviously handle this myself"?

### Step 1: Review Framework
Read `1-escalation-framework.md` to understand when and how to escalate

### Step 2: Use Decision Tree
Work through the escalation decision tree to determine if escalation is needed

### Step 3: Try Self-Resolution First
Complete the self-checklist before escalating

### Step 4: Use Communication Templates
Follow the SIOR framework and use scenario-specific templates

### Step 5: Follow Up
Track the escalation and follow up if needed

### Step 6: Document and Learn
Document the outcome and learn for future similar situations

## When to Use

- Cross-team conflicts you can't resolve
- Technical feasibility questions requiring leadership input
- Resource/budget needs beyond your authority
- Scope/priority changes conflicting with commitments
- Decisions requiring executive authority

## How to Maintain

- **After Each Escalation**: Document outcome and learnings
- **Quarterly Review**: Review escalation patterns and improve processes
- **Regular Training**: Practice escalation scenarios with team
