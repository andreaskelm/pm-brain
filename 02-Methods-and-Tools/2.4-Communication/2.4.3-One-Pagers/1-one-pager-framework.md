# One-Pager Framework

## Overview

This framework helps product teams create compelling one-page documents that drive alignment and action. One-pagers are NOT bureaucracy—they're strategic communication tools that enable quick decision-making and clear communication.

## Core Philosophy

### Good Communication is NOT Optional

Effective one-pagers should:

- **Drive decisions over discussions** - Move things forward, not in circles
- **Respect time over tradition** - Every word must add value
- **Enable clarity over comprehension** - Make understanding effortless
- **Foster action over information** - Create clear next steps

### Understanding One-Pagers

**ONE-PAGERS (Asynchronous Communication)**

- Standalone documents that inform and persuade
- Enable pre-reading and independent review
- Create lasting reference materials
- Time-efficient and distributable

## For Agents: When to Suggest This Framework

**Trigger conditions:**
- User mentions: "one-pager", "one pager", "executive summary", "decision doc", "proposal doc", "need to get buy-in"
- User is in: `execution_mode` (after braindump) or when user asks to create a communication doc
- Prerequisites: User has a decision to make, proposal to share, or needs stakeholder alignment
- User has: Clear ask or decision they want to drive (may need help clarifying)

**How to introduce:**
- "You need to communicate [proposal/decision/strategy] to stakeholders. Let's create a one-pager that drives alignment and action."
- "Based on your thinking about [topic], let's structure this as a one-pager so stakeholders can quickly understand and make a decision."

**Common mistakes to avoid:**
- Don't suggest one-pager if user hasn't clarified their ask (help them define what decision they want)
- Don't create docs that bury the lead (lead with the ask/decision)
- Don't suggest one-pager if user needs detailed documentation (use PRD or comprehensive docs)
- Don't create jargon-heavy docs (must be clear and accessible)

**When NOT to use this framework:**
- User needs detailed requirements (use PRD)
- User needs comprehensive strategy doc (use Strategy frameworks)
- User needs meeting notes or agenda (use Meeting Agendas framework)
- User needs ongoing communication (use Newsletter framework)

## Framework Structure

### 1. Header Section

Always include:

- **Disclaimer** - "One-pagers should be adapted to your audience and context"
- **Last updated date**
- **Framework owner**

### 2. One-Pager Types

**Product One-Pager**
- Propose new product/feature, get buy-in
- Need executive approval
- Cross-functional alignment required

**Strategy One-Pager**
- Communicate product strategy and direction
- Quarterly planning
- Strategy changes

**Launch One-Pager**
- Coordinate product launch across teams
- Preparing for launch
- Cross-functional coordination

**Decision One-Pager**
- Get decision on specific issue/trade-off
- Need executive decision
- Major trade-off to evaluate

**Project Status One-Pager**
- Update stakeholders on project progress
- Monthly/quarterly updates
- High-visibility projects

### 3. Universal Structure

Every one-pager should follow this basic structure:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│ TITLE/HEADLINE (attention) │
├─────────────────────────────────┤
│ TL;DR/Executive Summary │
│ (2-3 sentences max) │
├─────────────────────────────────┤
│ PROBLEM │
│ (Why this matters) │
├─────────────────────────────────┤
│ SOLUTION/PROPOSAL │
│ (What we're proposing) │
├─────────────────────────────────┤
│ WHY NOW │
│ (Timing/urgency) │
├─────────────────────────────────┤
│ IMPACT │
│ (Expected outcomes) │
├─────────────────────────────────┤
│ APPROACH/PLAN │
│ (How we'll do it) │
├─────────────────────────────────┤
│ TRADE-OFFS/RISKS │
│ (What we're not doing) │
├─────────────────────────────────┤
│ ASK/DECISION NEEDED │
│ (What we need from reader) │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Writing Guidelines

### Writing Style

**Do's:**

- ✅ Write for busy executives (assume 3-minute read time)
- ✅ Lead with the punchline (TL;DR first)
- ✅ Use specific numbers and data
- ✅ Be concise (every word must earn its place)
- ✅ Use formatting (bold, bullets, whitespace)
- ✅ Tell a story (problem → solution → impact)

**Don'ts:**

- ❌ Use jargon or acronyms without defining them
- ❌ Write long paragraphs (3-4 sentences max)
- ❌ Bury the lead (get to the point fast)
- ❌ Be vague ("improve significantly" → "increase by 25%")
- ❌ Assume prior context (provide just enough)
- ❌ Include everything (this isn't the PRD)

### Formatting Best Practices

**Visual Hierarchy:**

```
Use this order of prominence:
1. Headlines (═══ or bold, large)
2. Section headers (─── or bold)
3. Key numbers/metrics (bold or highlighted)
4. Bullet points (keep to 3-5 per section)
5. Body text (short paragraphs)
```

**Whitespace:**

- Leave breathing room between sections
- Don't cram to fit on one page (better to be clear than squeezed)
- Use section dividers

**Data Visualization:**

- Simple charts > tables > paragraphs
- One chart can replace 100 words
- Make sure axes/labels are clear

## Review Schedule

### Before Sharing

- [ ] Reviewed by peer for clarity
- [ ] Checked for jargon and acronyms
- [ ] Verified all numbers are accurate
- [ ] Confirmed decision/ask is clear
- [ ] Tested with one person from target audience

### After Sharing

- [ ] Track if decision was made
- [ ] Note questions or confusion
- [ ] Update based on feedback
- [ ] Archive for future reference

## Stakeholder Communication

### For Leadership

- Focus on business impact and strategic alignment
- Highlight trade-offs and risks explicitly
- Make the ask crystal clear
- Provide context but keep it brief

### For Cross-Functional Teams

- Emphasize how this affects their work
- Show dependencies clearly
- Make timeline and resource needs explicit
- Create shared understanding

### For Executives

- Lead with the business case
- Show ROI and impact
- Make decision criteria clear
- Provide recommendation with rationale

## Common Challenges and Solutions

### "This is too long for one page"

**Response pattern:**
"One-pagers don't have to literally be one page—they should be concise and scannable. If you need 1.5 pages to be clear, that's fine. The goal is clarity, not arbitrary page limits."

### "I don't know what decision I need"

**Response pattern:**
"Start with what you're trying to achieve. What's blocking you? What would unblock you? That's your decision. If you're not sure, that's a signal you need to think through the problem more first."

### "My stakeholder won't read this"

**Response pattern:**
"Make the TL;DR so compelling they can't ignore it. Put the decision/ask in the first paragraph. If they only read one section, make sure it's the TL;DR and it tells them everything they need to know."

## Best Practices

### Do's

- Start with the problem, not the solution
- Use data to support claims
- Make the ask explicit and time-bound
- Include trade-offs and risks
- Test with one person before broad distribution
- Update based on feedback

### Don'ts

- Don't bury the lead
- Don't assume prior knowledge
- Don't use vague language
- Don't skip the problem statement
- Don't forget the decision/ask
- Don't make it longer than necessary

## One-Pager Success Metrics

Track these to know if your one-pagers are effective:

- **Decision velocity** - Are decisions made faster?
- **Clarity** - Do stakeholders understand without follow-up questions?
- **Action** - Do people take the requested action?
- **Reusability** - Can others use this as a template?
- **Stakeholder satisfaction** - Do readers find them valuable?

## Quick Quality Checks (Use During Creation)

**Purpose:** Catch common issues early while creating one-pagers. The agent will automatically scan for these red flags during creation conversations.

### Top Red Flags to Watch For

❌ **Unclear ask** - Decision/action needed is not clear  
→ **Fix:** Specify decision upfront. Ask: "What decision do you need? What action should they take?"

❌ **Missing context** - Reader lacks context to understand the problem  
→ **Fix:** Add context. Ask: "What does the reader need to know to understand this?"

❌ **Jargon-heavy** - Uses jargon or acronyms without defining them  
→ **Fix:** Define jargon. Ask: "Would someone outside your team understand this? Define acronyms."

❌ **No clear decision/action** - Doesn't specify what decision is needed  
→ **Fix:** Add decision. Ask: "What specific decision do you need? When?"

❌ **Buries the lead** - Key information buried in middle or end  
→ **Fix:** Lead with punchline. Ask: "What's the most important thing? Put it first."

❌ **Missing data** - Claims not supported by numbers or evidence  
→ **Fix:** Add data. Ask: "What numbers support this claim? What's the baseline? Target?"

❌ **Vague language** - Uses vague terms like "improve significantly"  
→ **Fix:** Be specific. Ask: "What does 'significantly' mean? Use specific numbers."

❌ **Wrong audience** - Written for wrong audience or assumes too much prior knowledge  
→ **Fix:** Align with audience. Ask: "Who is this for? What do they already know?"

### Quick Product Sense Questions (Ask Yourself)

- What's your gut feeling about this one-pager? What feels right? What feels off?
- If you had to explain this one-pager to a skeptical executive in 2 minutes, what would you say?
- What would make you say "this one-pager is obviously wrong"?
- What would make you say "this one-pager is obviously right"?
- What does your product sense tell you about the ask? Is it clear what decision is needed?
- Does this one-pager feel like it will drive action? What action might it drive instead?
- What biases might be affecting your view? (Information overload? Unclear ask? Wrong audience?)

### Green Flags (What Good One-Pagers Look Like)

✅ Clear ask/decision specified upfront  
✅ Problem clearly stated with context  
✅ Specific numbers and data support claims  
✅ TL;DR/executive summary leads with punchline  
✅ Decision/action is crystal clear  
✅ Written for target audience (appropriate level of detail)  
✅ Trade-offs and risks addressed  
✅ Scannable format (headings, bullets, whitespace)
