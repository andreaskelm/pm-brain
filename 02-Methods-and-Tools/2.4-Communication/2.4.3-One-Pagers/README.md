# One-Pager Framework

## Introduction

This framework helps product teams create compelling one-page documents that drive alignment and action. One-pagers are NOT bureaucracy—they're strategic communication tools that enable quick decision-making and clear communication.

## Files
- `1-one-pager-framework.md` — Complete one-pager framework with principles, structure, and best practices
- `2-one-pager-templates.md` — Ready-to-use templates for Product, Strategy, Launch, Decision, and Status one-pagers

## Before Using This Framework

⚠️ **Don't jump straight to writing.**

### 1. Read the Golden Rule

**See:** [`/PRODUCT-SENSE-RULES.md`](../../../../PRODUCT-SENSE-RULES.md)

### 2. Braindump First (10 min)

**Use the prompts:** [`02-Methods-and-Tools/2.0-Foundations/2.0.1-Mental-Models/6-Product-Sense-Development/2-product-sense-template.md`](../../../../02-Methods-and-Tools/2.0-Foundations/2.0.1-Mental-Models/6-Product-Sense-Development/2-product-sense-template.md)

Specifically, the "Before Talking to Stakeholders" section:
- What do I actually need from them?
- What's in it for them?
- What objections do I expect?

**One-pagers communicate thinking—they don't create it.**

### 3. Then Use This Framework

After your braindump, use templates to structure your communication.

## How to Use This Framework

### Step 1: Review Framework
Read `1-one-pager-framework.md` to understand one-pager principles and structure

### Step 2: Choose Template Type
Select the appropriate template (Product, Strategy, Launch, Decision, or Status)

### Step 3: Use Template
Copy the relevant template from `2-one-pager-templates.md` and fill it in

### Step 4: Quality Check
Review against the quality checklist before sharing

### Step 5: Test with One Person
Have someone from your target audience review it first

### Step 6: Share and Track
Distribute to stakeholders and track if decision/action is taken

### Step 7: Self-Reflection
After sharing, reflect:
- Was the decision made? Was action taken?
- What questions came up? What was unclear?
- What would you do differently next time?

## When to Use

- Proposing new products/features (Product One-Pager)
- Communicating strategy (Strategy One-Pager)
- Coordinating launches (Launch One-Pager)
- Getting executive decisions (Decision One-Pager)
- Updating stakeholders (Status One-Pager)

## How to Maintain

- **Before Sharing**: Quality check and peer review
- **After Sharing**: Track decisions/actions, note questions
- **Archive**: Keep successful one-pagers as templates for future use
