# One-Pager Framework

## Introduction

This framework helps product teams create compelling one-page documents that drive alignment and action. One-pagers are NOT bureaucracy—they're strategic communication tools that enable quick decision-making and clear communication.

## Files
- `1-one-pager-framework.md` — Complete one-pager framework with principles, structure, and best practices
- `2-one-pager-templates.md` — Ready-to-use templates for Product, Strategy, Launch, Decision, and Status one-pagers

## How to Use This Framework

### Step 0: Braindump & Think First (Critical!)

**Before writing a one-pager, braindump:**
- What are you trying to communicate? Dump everything - don't structure yet.
- What does your product sense tell you? What's the core message?
- What assumptions are you making? What does your audience already know?
- What biases might affect your writing? (Solution bias? Too much detail? Too little context?)

**Product sense exercise:**
- If you had 30 seconds to explain this, what would you say?
- What would make you say "this one-pager is obviously wrong"?
- What would make you say "this one-pager is obviously right"?

### Step 1: Review Framework
Read `1-one-pager-framework.md` to understand one-pager principles and structure

### Step 2: Choose Template Type
Select the appropriate template (Product, Strategy, Launch, Decision, or Status)

### Step 3: Use Template
Copy the relevant template from `2-one-pager-templates.md` and fill it in

### Step 4: Quality Check
Review against the quality checklist before sharing

### Step 5: Test with One Person
Have someone from your target audience review it first

### Step 6: Share and Track
Distribute to stakeholders and track if decision/action is taken

### Step 7: Self-Reflection
After sharing, reflect:
- Was the decision made? Was action taken?
- What questions came up? What was unclear?
- What would you do differently next time?

## When to Use

- Proposing new products/features (Product One-Pager)
- Communicating strategy (Strategy One-Pager)
- Coordinating launches (Launch One-Pager)
- Getting executive decisions (Decision One-Pager)
- Updating stakeholders (Status One-Pager)

## How to Maintain

- **Before Sharing**: Quality check and peer review
- **After Sharing**: Track decisions/actions, note questions
- **Archive**: Keep successful one-pagers as templates for future use
