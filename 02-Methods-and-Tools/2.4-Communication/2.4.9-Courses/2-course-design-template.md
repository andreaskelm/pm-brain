# Course Design Template: Step-by-Step Ideation Process

## Overview
This template provides a systematic 7-step process (95 minutes total) to design any course using the Brain-Based Learning (4Cs) model. Use this alongside the framework document for detailed guidance.

**Before you start**: Review the [framework document](./1-course-design-framework.md) to understand the 4Cs model and brain-based principles.

## Step-by-Step Course Ideation Process

### Step 1: Define Your Course Foundation (15 minutes)
Start by clarifying the core elements:

**Learning Context Questions:**
- What is the main topic/skill you want to teach?
- Who is your target audience (role, experience level, context)?
- What specific problem does this course solve for learners?
- How much time do you have (single session, multi-session, duration)?
- What organizational challenges are you addressing?

**Example Output:**
> Topic: Stakeholder Management for Project Managers
> Audience: Mid-level PMs with 2+ years experience at tech company
> Problem: PMs struggle with conflicting stakeholder priorities
> Format: 3-hour workshop, max 15 people
> Org Challenge: Projects delayed due to stakeholder misalignment

### Step 2: Brainstorm Learning Outcomes (10 minutes)
Use this template to generate 3-5 specific learning outcomes:

**Template:** "By the end of this course, participants will be able to [action verb] [specific skill/knowledge] [in what context] [to achieve what result]."

**Action Verb Bank:**
- Identify, analyze, evaluate, create, facilitate, apply, design, implement, prioritize, negotiate

**Example Outcomes:**
- Identify different stakeholder types and their motivations in project contexts
- Apply stakeholder mapping techniques to prioritize engagement strategies
- Facilitate stakeholder alignment meetings to resolve conflicting priorities

### Step 3: Map Content to 4Cs Structure (20 minutes)
For each learning outcome, brainstorm content using the 4Cs:

**C1 - Connections Brainstorm:**
- What experiences do learners already have with this topic?
- What current challenges can they relate to?
- What assumptions might they hold?
- How can you create "aha moments" by connecting to their reality?

**C2 - Concepts Brainstorm:**
- What are the core frameworks/models to teach?
- How can you make each concept visual?
- What audio elements could illustrate the concept (stories, interviews)?
- What kinesthetic activities could help them experience the concept?

**C3 - Practice Brainstorm:**
- What real-world scenarios can they practice with?
- What templates or tools can they use?
- How can they teach/review with peers?
- What progression from simple to complex can you create?

**C4 - Conclusions Brainstorm:**
- What key insights should they capture?
- What specific actions can they commit to?
- How will they apply this in their current work?
- What accountability structures can you create?

### Step 4: Generate Activity Ideas (15 minutes)
Use these prompts to brainstorm specific activities:

**Connection Activities:**
- "Think of a time when..." reflection prompts
- Experience sharing in pairs or small groups
- Current state assessment exercises
- Problem identification from their context

**Concept Activities (Multi-sensory):**
- Visual: Create comparison charts, process maps, framework diagrams
- Audio: Record case studies, stakeholder interviews, success stories
- Kinesthetic: Card sorting, role reversal, physical mapping, sticky note clustering
- Discussion: Pattern recognition, small group analysis, debate

**Practice Activities:**
- Scenario-based problem solving using their real challenges
- Template completion with authentic data
- Peer coaching and feedback sessions
- Progressive skill-building exercises
- Simulation or role-playing of difficult situations

**Conclusion Activities:**
- Personal action planning with specific commitments
- Accountability partner matching
- Insight capture on individual reflection cards
- Group commitment ceremonies or public declarations

### Step 5: Design Session Flow (15 minutes)
Create your session structure using these guidelines:

**Time Allocation Rules:**
- Connections: 10-20% of total time
- Concepts: 25-30% of total time  
- Practice: 40-50% of total time
- Conclusions: 10-15% of total time

**Energy Management:**
- Start each major section with movement or interaction
- Alternate between individual and group work
- Include energizers after concept-heavy segments
- Plan breaks every 60-90 minutes

**Flow Template:**
1. **Opening Connection** (link to their world)
2. **Concept Introduction** (multi-sensory)
3. **Initial Practice** (low-stakes application)
4. **Deeper Practice** (real-world application)
5. **Peer Review/Teaching** (solidify learning)
6. **Personal Commitment** (action planning)

### Step 6: Identify Required Materials (10 minutes)
Brainstorm what you'll need:

**Content Materials:**
- Frameworks to visualize
- Case studies to record/present
- Templates for practice activities
- Real scenarios for problem-solving

**Physical Materials:**
- Sticky notes, markers, flip chart paper
- Timers for timeboxing activities
- Name tags, table tents
- Handouts and worksheets

**Room/Technology Setup:**
- Table configuration for group work
- Wall space for posting work
- Projection/screen capabilities
- Audio setup if needed

### Step 7: Plan Facilitation Approach (10 minutes)
Consider your facilitation needs:

**Group Management:**
- How will you form groups?
- How will you ensure equal participation?
- What techniques will you use for shy participants?
- How will you handle dominant personalities?

**Time Management:**
- What signals will you use for transitions?
- How will you keep activities on track?
- What backup activities do you have if things run short/long?

**Adaptation Strategies:**
- How will you adjust if comprehension is low/high?
- What alternative explanations do you have ready?
- How will you handle unexpected questions or challenges?

## Final Validation Checklist
Before finalizing your course design, check:

- [ ] Does each learning outcome have all 4Cs addressed?
- [ ] Is 40-50% of time dedicated to hands-on practice?
- [ ] Are multiple sensory learning styles accommodated?
- [ ] Is there movement/interaction every 20-30 minutes?
- [ ] Do practice activities use authentic, relevant scenarios?
- [ ] Is there a clear path from learning to application?
- [ ] Are participants committing to specific next steps?
- [ ] Have you planned for different learning paces?
- [ ] Are there opportunities for peer teaching/learning?
- [ ] Does the energy flow make sense (high/low energy balance)?
