# Course Design Framework & Templates

This folder contains frameworks and templates for designing engaging, brain-based learning experiences using the 4Cs instructional design model.

## What's Included

### 📋 Framework Document
**[1-course-design-framework.md](./1-course-design-framework.md)**
- Complete Brain-Based Learning (4Cs) framework
- Core structure and principles
- Course structure templates for different durations
- Planning framework and success metrics
- Customization guidelines for different contexts

### 🛠️ Template Document  
**[2-course-design-template.md](./2-course-design-template.md)**
- Step-by-step ideation process (7 steps, ~95 minutes total)
- Practical worksheets and templates
- Activity brainstorming prompts
- Validation checklist
- Ready-to-use planning templates

## Quick Start Guide

### 🚀 First-Time Users (Start Here):
1. **Understand the basics** - Read the Framework Overview in `1-course-design-framework.md`
2. **See the visual summary** - Review the 4Cs model diagram
3. **Follow the step-by-step process** - Use the ideation section (7 steps, ~95 minutes)
4. **Validate your design** - Complete the final checklist

### 📈 For New Course Creation:
1. **Start with the ideation process** - Follow the 7-step process in the framework document
2. **Allow sufficient time** - Block 95 minutes for full course design
3. **Use the templates** - Complete the worksheet provided in step 8
4. **Validate thoroughly** - Use the checklist to ensure brain-based principles are applied

### 🔄 For Existing Course Improvement:
1. **Quick assessment** - Review your current design against the 4Cs model (15 minutes)
2. **Identify gaps** - Check brain-based principles and time allocation (15 minutes)
3. **Plan improvements** - Focus on 2-3 key enhancements rather than complete redesign
4. **Test changes** - Pilot improvements in next session

## Key Principles Summary

### The 4Cs Structure:
- **C1 - Connections** (10-20%): Link to existing knowledge and experience
- **C2 - Concepts** (25-30%): Multi-sensory introduction of new information  
- **C3 - Concrete Practice** (40-50%): Hands-on application and skill building
- **C4 - Conclusions** (10-15%): Synthesis, reflection, and commitment to action

### Brain-Based Design Elements:
- **Movement** trumps sitting
- **Writing** trumps reading  
- **Talking** trumps listening
- **Shorter** trumps longer
- **Images** trump words
- **Different** trumps same

## Time Investment for Course Design

### Full Course Design Process: ~95 minutes
- Step 1: Course Foundation (15 min)
- Step 2: Learning Outcomes (10 min) 
- Step 3: 4Cs Content Mapping (20 min)
- Step 4: Activity Generation (15 min)
- Step 5: Session Flow Design (15 min)
- Step 6: Materials Planning (10 min)
- Step 7: Facilitation Approach (10 min)

### Quick Course Review: ~30 minutes
- Review existing course against 4Cs structure
- Identify gaps in brain-based principles
- Plan 2-3 key improvements

## When to Use This Framework

### Ideal For:
- Professional development courses
- Skills-based training programs
- Workshop design
- Team learning sessions
- Change management training

### Best Fit Duration:
- Single sessions: 2-4 hours
- Multi-session courses: 2-8 sessions
- Workshop series: Half-day to multi-day formats

### Target Audience:
- Adult learners in professional contexts
- Groups of 8-25 participants
- Mixed experience levels within same domain

## Success Metrics

### During Course Indicators:
- High engagement in activities (>80% active participation)
- Quality peer teaching moments
- Relevant questions and examples from participants
- Time spent in practice vs. concept phases (40-50% practice)

### Post-Course Indicators:
- Participants applying frameworks in real work (within 2 weeks)
- Requests for follow-up sessions or advanced topics
- Behavior change observations from managers/peers
- Measurable improvements in target competencies

## Customization Notes

### For Different Industries:
- Replace examples with industry-specific scenarios
- Use domain-relevant terminology and frameworks
- Include industry stakeholder perspectives

### For Different Experience Levels:
- **Beginners**: More connection time, simpler concepts, guided practice
- **Advanced**: Less connection, complex scenarios, peer teaching opportunities
- **Mixed Groups**: Tiered activities, flexible grouping strategies

### For Different Formats:
- **Virtual**: Add chat interactions, breakout rooms, shared digital tools
- **Hybrid**: Balance in-person kinesthetic with digital collaboration
- **Asynchronous**: Include reflection journals, peer feedback loops
