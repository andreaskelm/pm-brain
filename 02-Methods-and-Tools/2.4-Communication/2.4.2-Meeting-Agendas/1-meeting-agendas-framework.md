# Meeting Agendas Framework

## Overview

This framework helps product teams run effective meetings that drive decisions and action. Meetings are NOT bureaucracy—they're strategic communication tools that enable alignment and progress.

## Core Philosophy

### Good Communication is NOT Optional

Effective meetings should:

- **Drive decisions over discussions** - Move things forward, not in circles
- **Respect time over tradition** - Every minute must add value
- **Enable clarity over comprehension** - Make understanding effortless
- **Foster action over information** - Create clear next steps

### Understanding Meetings

**MEETINGS (Synchronous Communication)**

- Real-time collaboration and decision-making
- Build alignment and shared understanding
- Resolve complex issues through dialogue
- Time-sensitive and focused

-----

## Step 0: Braindump & Think First (Critical!)

**Before scheduling any meeting, braindump:**
- What are you trying to accomplish? Dump everything - don't structure yet.
- What does your product sense tell you? Is a meeting really needed?
- What assumptions are you making? Could this be async instead?
- What biases might affect your meeting planning? (Meeting for meeting's sake? Status update trap?)

**Product sense exercise:**
- If you had to accomplish this in 15 minutes, how would you do it?
- What would make you say "this meeting is obviously unnecessary"?
- What would make you say "this meeting is obviously valuable"?

## Disclaimer

Meeting structures should serve your team’s needs, not the other way around. Adapt these frameworks to your context—the principles matter more than rigid adherence.

## ⚠️ Meeting Anti-Patterns

### Anti-Pattern #1: Meeting for Meeting’s Sake

**What it looks like:**

- Recurring meetings with no clear purpose
- “We’ve always had this meeting”
- Low attendance, people multitasking

**Why it’s harmful:**

- Wastes time and energy
- Breeds meeting fatigue
- Actual important meetings get ignored

**Solution:**

- Challenge every recurring meeting quarterly
- Cancel if no agenda 24 hours before
- Make attendance optional when appropriate
- Consider asynchronous alternatives

-----

### Anti-Pattern #2: Status Update Meetings

**What it looks like:**

- Everyone reports what they did
- No discussion or decisions
- Could have been an email/Slack update

**Why it’s harmful:**

- Doesn’t require synchronous time
- People zone out during others’ updates
- No value in real-time gathering

**Solution:**

- Move status updates to written format
- Use meeting time for discussion/decisions only
- If someone needs clarity, they can ask questions async
- Save meetings for complex topics

-----

### Anti-Pattern #3: The Never-Ending Meeting

**What it looks like:**

- Consistently runs over time
- No clear endpoint
- People have to leave for next meeting

**Why it’s harmful:**

- Disrespects people’s time
- Creates cascade of late meetings
- Important items at end get rushed

**Solution:**

- Strict timeboxing with visible timer
- Agenda with time allocations
- Park off-topic discussions
- End 5 min early to allow transitions

-----

### Anti-Pattern #4: No Decisions Made

**What it looks like:**

- Lots of discussion, no conclusions
- Same topics every meeting
- Unclear who decides what

**Why it’s harmful:**

- Progress stalls
- Meeting feels pointless
- Creates meeting-after-the-meeting

**Solution:**

- Clarify decision-making process upfront (consensus? majority? leader decides?)
- End each topic with explicit decision or next step
- Document decisions immediately
- Assign owners to actions

-----

### Anti-Pattern #5: Wrong People in the Room

**What it looks like:**

- Key decision-makers absent
- Too many “FYI” attendees
- Wrong expertise for topics

**Why it’s harmful:**

- Can’t make decisions
- Have to schedule another meeting
- Signal-to-noise ratio low

**Solution:**

- Required vs. optional attendance
- Send notes to FYI people
- Reschedule if key people unavailable
- Create smaller working groups

-----

## ✅ Meeting Effectiveness Checklist

**Before scheduling any meeting, ask:**

- [ ] Is this meeting necessary, or could it be an email/doc/Slack?
- [ ] What specific decision or outcome do we need?
- [ ] Who MUST be there (can’t proceed without them)?
- [ ] Have I shared pre-work/context 24+ hours before?
- [ ] Is the agenda clear with time allocations?
- [ ] Have I timebox this appropriately (shortest possible)?

**After every meeting:**

- [ ] Did we accomplish the stated objective?
- [ ] Were decisions made and documented?
- [ ] Do action items have owners and due dates?
- [ ] Were notes shared within 24 hours?
- [ ] Could this meeting have been shorter/async?
- [ ] What will we do differently next time?
