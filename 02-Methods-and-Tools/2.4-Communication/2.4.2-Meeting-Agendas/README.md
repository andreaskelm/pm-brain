# Meeting Agendas Framework

## Introduction

This framework helps product teams run effective meetings that drive decisions and action. Meetings are NOT bureaucracy—they're strategic communication tools that enable alignment and progress.

## Files
- `1-meeting-agendas-framework.md` — Complete meeting framework with principles and best practices
- `2-meeting-agenda-templates.md` — Ready-to-use agenda templates for different meeting types

## How to Use This Framework

### Step 0: Braindump & Think First (Critical!)

**Before scheduling any meeting, braindump:**
- What are you trying to accomplish? Dump everything - don't structure yet.
- What does your product sense tell you? Is a meeting really needed?
- What assumptions are you making? Could this be async instead?
- What biases might affect your meeting planning? (Meeting for meeting's sake? Status update trap?)

**Product sense exercise:**
- If you had to accomplish this in 15 minutes, how would you do it?
- What would make you say "this meeting is obviously unnecessary"?
- What would make you say "this meeting is obviously valuable"?

### Step 1: Review Framework

### Step 5: Facilitate Meeting
Follow the agenda, keep on track, document decisions

### Step 6: Follow Up

### Step 7: Self-Reflection
After the meeting, reflect:
- Did we accomplish the goal?
