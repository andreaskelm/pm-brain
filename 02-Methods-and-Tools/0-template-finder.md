# 0 – Template Finder

**What this file is:** Entry when you already know **what document** you need (PRD, one-pager, OKR, opportunity assessment, etc.). Go straight to the right framework README + template. For **topic** lookup (e.g. “everything about prioritization” or “mental models for decision-making”), use [1-frameworks-by-topic.md](1-frameworks-by-topic.md). If you haven’t thought it through yet, use [0-start-here-product-thinking.md](2.0-Foundations/2.0.1-Mental-Models/6-Product-Sense-Development/0-start-here-product-thinking.md) and braindump first.

**Agent note:** For non-trivial docs (PRD, Strategy, Opportunity Assessment, Roadmap), you **must ask** 2–3 preflight prompts from `2-product-sense-prompts.md` before helping fill in the template. Required prompts:
- "Why this, why now?"
- "What do you already know vs. what are you guessing?"
- "Who is this for?" (if not clear from context)

For trivial docs (meeting agenda, newsletter), preflight is optional.

For non-trivial docs, also ask whether the user has added relevant company/initiative/research context, or if you should reference [01-Company-Context/](../01-Company-Context/README.md), [03-Research-Artifacts/](../03-Research-Artifacts/README.md), or [04-Initiatives/](../04-Initiatives/README.md).

**Reminder:** For non-trivial docs (strategy, PRD, big opportunity), braindump first: [0-start-here-product-thinking.md](2.0-Foundations/2.0.1-Mental-Models/6-Product-Sense-Development/0-start-here-product-thinking.md).
