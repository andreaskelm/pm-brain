# 1 – Frameworks by Topic

**What this file is:** Frameworks and mental models grouped by topic (bias, discovery, PRD, prioritization, etc.). Use when you want “everything about X.” For situation-based navigation after a braindump, use [0-start-here-product-thinking.md](2.0-Foundations/2.0.1-Mental-Models/6-Product-Sense-Development/0-start-here-product-thinking.md) → “Frameworks by situation.” For “I need a template now,” use [0-template-finder.md](0-template-finder.md).

Paths below are relative to `02-Methods-and-Tools/`.
