# Session Checkpoint — 2026-02-04 14:30

**Example format.** Use this as a reference when creating or resuming from checkpoints. See [ORCHESTRATION.md](../ORCHESTRATION.md) → Context Health for when to offer checkpoints and how to resume.

## Context

- **State:** product_sense
- **Started:** 2026-02-04 14:00
- **Turns:** 18
- **Topic:** Redesigning user onboarding flow

## Braindump Summary

Key insights from the user's thinking:

1. **Current onboarding has high drop-off** — users confused by setup flow, too many steps upfront.
2. **Power users love customization** — but new users feel overwhelmed by options.
3. **Sales wants faster activation** — pressure to reduce time-to-value.
4. **Engineering is skeptical** — last redesign didn't move metrics; worried about churn.
5. **Assumption being tested:** "If we simplify upfront, power users will still find customization later."

**Uncomfortable truth identified:** We're redesigning without validating what actually causes drop-off.

**Risk surfaced:** Optimizing for activation might hurt long-term retention if we remove too much.

## Questions Explored

1. **"What's your theory on why users drop off?"**  
   → User's hypothesis: Too many decisions upfront, unclear value prop, setup feels like work.

2. **"What happens if you're wrong about power users finding customization later?"**  
   → Could lose our differentiator; become "just another tool."

3. **"Who's advocating for the current onboarding? What do they know that you don't?"**  
   → Engineering built it from power user feedback; sales says prospects love the demo (but that's pre-signup).

4. **"What's the smallest thing you could test before redesigning?"**  
   → User idea: A/B test a simplified first step, measure completion vs churn.

5. **"What would make sales/engineering say 'this redesign made it worse'?"**  
   → Lower activation with no impact on revenue, or higher activation but higher churn.

## Framework Candidates

| Framework | Why it fits | Location |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| **Jobs-to-Be-Done** | Need to understand why users "hire" the product for onboarding. | 02-Methods-and-Tools/2.2-Discovery/2.2.3-Jobs-To-Be-Done/ |
| **Opportunity Assessment** | Validate the opportunity before building. | 02-Methods-and-Tools/2.2-Discovery/2.2.4-Opportunity-Assessment/ |
| **Problem-Solution Space** | Separate "what's the problem" from "what's the solution." | 02-Methods-and-Tools/2.2-Discovery/2.2.6-Problem-Solution-Space/ |

**Next step:** User to choose framework (or continue thinking). Opportunity Assessment feels strongest fit.

## Context Loaded

- **Company:** 01-Company-Context/ (strategy, North Star; team structure)
- **Research:** 03-Research-Artifacts/ (onboarding analytics, drop-off data)
- **Initiatives:** 04-Initiatives/onboarding-redesign/ (existing project folder)

---

## Next Steps

1. User chooses framework — or continues thinking.
2. If choosing framework: consider checkpoint and fresh conversation before drafting artifact.
3. Preflight questions before drafting (audience, why now, success).
4. **Alternative:** User might want to validate drop-off causes with research before redesigning.

---

**To resume:** Start a new conversation and say: "Continue from checkpoints/example-session.md" (or use the real checkpoint filename, e.g. `checkpoints/session-2026-02-04-1430.md`). The agent reads the file, summarizes where things stand, and continues from there.
