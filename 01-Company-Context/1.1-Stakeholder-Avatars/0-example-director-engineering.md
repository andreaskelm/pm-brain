### Alex — Director of Engineering

#### Identity & Relationship
- **Organization position**: Leads the Eng group for your area; your manager reports to Alex.
- **Time working together**: ~18 months.
- **Relationship summary**: Generally supportive but cautious; trusts your product sense more than your execution follow-through.

#### Explicit Goals (What they say they care about)
- "Reliable delivery without burning the team out."
- Reducing incident volume and keeping on-call sustainable.
- Hitting hiring goals for senior ICs and tech leads.

#### Implicit Goals (What they might not say out loud)
- Wants to be seen by the VP Eng as "the safe pair of hands" for risky bets.
- A bit wary of taking on work that depends heavily on other orgs they don't control.

#### Fears & Risks
- Another major incident tied to your area that makes their group look chaotic.
- Losing senior engineers because of rushed, poorly scoped commitments.

#### Incentives & Levers
- **What moves them to support something:**
  - Clear impact on reliability, maintainability, or developer experience.
  - Evidence from real incidents and ticket volume trends.
  - Strong commitment from leadership to fund headcount or de-scope elsewhere.
- **Evidence that changed their mind in the past:**
  - A simple incident postmortem that tied a feature gap directly to multiple outages.

#### Tone of Voice & Behaviour
- **In groups:** Calm, measured, often plays "risk narrator" in planning meetings.
- **In 1:1s:** More candid, occasionally jokes about politics and bandwidth.
- **Style:** Direct but not aggressive; prefers data backed by stories.
- **Example phrases:**
  - "What happens when this fails at 3 a.m.?"
  - "Show me the incident stats, not just vibes."
  - "I'm not against this, but we can't pretend it's free."

#### History With You
- **Backed you on:**
  - Approving a refactor that reduced incident load after you brought clear data.
- **Blocked / slowed you on:**
  - Pushed back on a cross-team feature because integration risk felt too high.
- **Unresolved tension or scars:**
  - Concerned about a previous slip where scope ballooned late and stressed the team.

#### Brainfeed Stream (How they'd react)
- **Good news scenario:**
  - **Out loud:** "If this genuinely reduces incident load, I'm in. Let's see the numbers."
  - **Inner monologue:** "This could buy us political capital if it actually stabilizes things."
- **Bad news or surprise change:**
  - **Out loud:** "We need to understand how we got here before we sign up for more."
  - **Inner monologue:** "I don't want my team to be the catch-all for every strategic whim again."
