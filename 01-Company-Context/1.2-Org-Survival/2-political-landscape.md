# Political Landscape

Use this file to map **alliances, fault lines, and landmines** so you don’t walk into a Red Wedding by accident.

## Active alliances

- Which leaders tend to move together (formal or informal alliances)?
- Which teams back each other up in conflicts?
- Who usually backs your manager or your area?

> Note concrete pairs/groups and what holds them together (shared goals, history, politics).

## Fault lines & tensions

- Historical feuds between teams or leaders.
- Long-running disagreements (e.g. platform vs product, central vs BU).
- Sensitive areas where debates become political fast.

> Capture patterns like “Data vs Infra always fight over ownership of X.”

## Protected systems / “pets”

- Systems, products, or projects that are politically protected (exec pet projects, legacy systems nobody is allowed to touch).
- Who is emotionally or politically attached to them?

> Note what happened to people who tried to change them (if relevant).

## Landmines (topics/narratives)

- Topics that trigger defensiveness (metrics, narratives, past incidents).
- Stories leadership tells themselves that you should not contradict lightly.

> Example: “We’re the most reliable team in the organization” + incident history that contradicts it; or “This product is our future” even if numbers don’t support it.
