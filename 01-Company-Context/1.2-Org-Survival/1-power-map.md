# Power Map

Use this file to capture **who actually has power** in your organization — not just titles, but who can say yes/no, who can quietly kill work, and who steers decisions.

## Formal power (organization chart)

- Who officially owns your area? (titles, reporting lines, budget owners)
- Which leaders sign off on major product/tech decisions?
- Who controls headcount and budget?

> List key people with titles and reporting lines that matter for your work.

## Actual power (how it really works)

- Who can *actually* say yes/no to your work, regardless of title?
- Who drives the agenda in key meetings?
- Whose opinion the room defers to, even if they’re not the highest title?

> Capture the gap between the formal organization chart and real influence.

## Veto holders

- Who can quietly block or stall a project without ever saying “no” out loud?
- Who has to be at least neutral for anything meaningful to ship?

> Name them and note how they tend to exercise veto (silence, endless questions, escalations, etc.).

## Shadow decision-makers

- Who influences key leaders behind the scenes (trusted advisors, chiefs of staff, staff engineers, “right-hand” people)?
- Who can change a decision *after* a meeting, in private conversations?

> Note how they influence decisions and where they sit in the organization.
