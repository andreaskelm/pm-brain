# Red Flags & Political History

Use this file to track **what has gone wrong politically** (Red Weddings, slow kills, quiet vetoes) and the patterns you want to watch for next time.

When we say **“Red Wedding”** here, we mean a situation where everything *looked* aligned and safe — people smiled in the room, nobody objected — but the real politics had already shifted elsewhere. Alliances changed, commitments were broken off-stage, and the project (or you) got ambushed and killed in a way you didn’t see coming.

## Red flags (checklist + log)

- Projects that died for reasons that “didn’t make sense” at the time.
- Stakeholders whose support evaporates when it matters.
- Repeated patterns (e.g. same team blocking similar work, same excuse used multiple times).

> Write short bullets: what happened, who was involved, what the *political* reason likely was (not just the stated reason).

## History snapshots

For significant incidents, capture a short snapshot:

- **What happened:**
- **Who was involved:**
- **Stated reason:**
- **Likely real reason:**
- **What you’d do differently next time:**

> This is your “decision archaeology” for politics — it helps you spot Red Wedding setups early.

## Links to initiatives

- For each major initiative, note where its red flags and political history live under `04-Initiatives/<name>/` (e.g. `red-flags.md`, `decision-log.md`).
- When you update those, consider updating this file too if you see a recurring pattern.
