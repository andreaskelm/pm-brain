# Organization Survival Cheat Sheet

This subfolder is your **organizational survival layer**: how power, politics, and timing really work in your company. It’s personal and agent-facing, not something you’d ever ship to stakeholders.

Use it together with:
- `6-company-stakeholders.md` (who exists in the organization),
- `1.1-Stakeholder-Avatars/` (person-level avatars for simulation),
- initiative docs under `04-Initiatives/` (decision logs, red flags, stakeholder alignment).

---

## For Agents

- **When to wake:** Big bets, controversial ideas, cross-organization work, or when politics smell off (fake support, sudden priority shifts, someone too quiet).
- **How to use with avatars:** Use `1.1-Stakeholder-Avatars/` for **person-level** simulations; use this folder for **system-level** patterns (power map, alliances, fault lines, red flags).
- **Where to log:** After politics passes or real incidents, suggest updating:
  - `1-power-map.md` (if you learned something about who really decides),
  - `2-political-landscape.md` (alliances, landmines),
  - `5-red-flags-and-history.md` (new red flags or Red Wedding-style events).
- **Caution:** This content is intentionally blunt about politics and incentives. Do not copy it verbatim into stakeholder-facing docs; translate into neutral, professional language.

## What a “Red Wedding” means here

When this folder talks about a “Red Wedding”, it means a situation where a project or person walks into a setting that **looks safe on the surface** (everyone seems aligned, smiling in the room) but the politics have **already shifted elsewhere** — alliances changed, commitments were broken, and the real decision was made off-stage. The apparent alignment is a trap; support evaporates, the project is killed, and you take the hit.

Use the red-flags and history file to capture those setups so you can spot similar patterns earlier next time.

## Files in this folder

- `1-power-map.md` — Who has formal vs actual power; veto holders; shadow decision-makers.
- `2-political-landscape.md` — Alliances, fault lines, protected systems, landmines.
- `3-stakeholder-games.md` — Common stakeholder games/archetypes and how to work with them.
- `4-coalitions-and-timing.md` — When to move, who to talk to first, how to build coalitions.
- `5-red-flags-and-history.md` — Running log of political history and red flags.

Each file is a **template-like note**: headings + prompts you fill in over time, not long essays.
