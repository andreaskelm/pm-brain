# Coalitions & Timing

In big orgs, **when** and **with whom** you move often matters more than how good your idea is. Use this file to think through timing and coalition-building before you go public.

## Timing

- When is pain most visible for the problem you’re solving?
- When are people too distracted (planning season, re-orgs, crises) to hear anything new?
- What upcoming events (QBRs, offsites, board meetings) create natural windows for your idea?

> Write a few sentences on “good timing” vs “bad timing” for major moves.

## Sequencing conversations

- Who do you need on side **before** any big group meeting?
- In what order do you want to talk to them (who helps you refine the idea vs who needs to feel consulted)?
- Who should hear it from you first vs from someone else?

> Sketch a simple sequence like: 1) Eng lead → 2) Design → 3) adjacent PMs → 4) VP.

## Coalitions

- Who naturally allies with your goals (teams that benefit, leaders who gain status or clarity)?
- Who might feel threatened or sidelined?
- Who can credibly advocate for this when you’re not in the room?

> Note 2–3 names you’d like in your coalition and what matters to them (pull from avatars + power map).
