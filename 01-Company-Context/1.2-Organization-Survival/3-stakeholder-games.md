# Stakeholder Games & Archetypes

People run patterns. This file names the **games** you see and how to work with them without getting burned. Focus on behaviors, not labels for specific people.

## How to use this file

- When you notice a pattern (“always says yes then disappears”, “takes credit in exec reviews”), add an archetype with:
  - **How they behave**
  - **How to work with them / protect yourself**
- Keep it short and concrete. Use avatars (`1.1-Stakeholder-Avatars/`) for person-level detail.

## Archetypes (examples to adapt)

### The Ghost Supporter

- **Behaviours:**
  - Says “great idea, I support this” in meetings.
  - Rarely shows up when decisions are actually made.
  - History of “supporting” projects that later died quietly.
- **How to work with / protect yourself:**
  - Treat their support as *nice-to-have*, not sufficient.
  - Pair their “yes” with support from someone who actually holds power.
  - Log their verbal support in decision docs so they can’t later disown it.

### The Defensive Owner

- **Behaviours:**
  - Reacts strongly to perceived criticism of their area/system.
  - Frames change as a threat to stability or reputation.
  - Uses “risk” language to slow or block changes.
- **How to work with / protect yourself:**
  - Start from their goals and fears (use their avatar).
  - Frame proposals as *protecting* or *strengthening* their area.
  - Give them early visibility and real input; don’t surprise them.

### The Fair Broker

- **Behaviours:**
  - Tries to balance competing interests.
  - Often mediates between teams.
  - Seen as “reasonable” by multiple sides.
- **How to work with / protect yourself:**
  - Use them as sounding board before big moves.
  - Make tradeoffs explicit and ask them what might look unfair.
  - Enlist them as ally in framing decisions.

### The Sniper

- **Behaviours:**
  - Stays quiet during discussions, then raises concerns later in side channels.
  - Brings up issues at the last possible moment (final review, exec sync).
  - Uses “just asking questions” to destabilize.
- **How to work with / protect yourself:**
  - Proactively invite their input early and document it.
  - In high-stakes forums, mention that you already socialized with them and what they said (if positive/neutral).
  - Capture their objections in red-flag docs and decision logs.

> Add more archetypes that match your organization. Keep them behaviour-focused, not personal attacks.
