## Top 10 things you should know

Welcome. This is the fast path to getting oriented in this repository and its company context. Skim this once, follow the links that feel relevant right now, and come back when you need a refresher.

1. **Why this directory exists**  
   `01-Company-Context/` is the home for your real company context: vision, strategy, principles, portfolio, roadmap, and stakeholders. Everything else in PM Brain takes its cues from here.

2. **Start with vision and strategy**  
   Read `1-company-vision.md` (the long-term \"why\") and `2-company-strategy.md` (the current \"what\"). These two files are the main inputs to OKRs, roadmaps, and most serious product decisions.

3. **Understand how product work is guided**  
   Skim `3-company-product-principles.md` to see the core principles and constraints that should shape feature decisions, tradeoffs, and how you work with other teams.

4. **Know what exists today**  
   Use `4-company-product-explanation.md` to understand the current product portfolio and key customer segments. This is your map of \"what we actually ship\" and who it is for.

5. **See the high-level plan**  
   Check `5-company-roadmap.md` for the big bets, major initiatives, and rough sequencing. Treat this as directional: confirm anything critical with stakeholders before assuming exact timelines.

6. **Learn who matters and why**  
   Read `6-company-stakeholders.md` plus the `1.1-Stakeholder-Avatars/` and `1.2-Organization-Survival/` folders for a sense of the people, power dynamics, and politics that shape decisions.

7. **Get the language for metrics**  
   Skim `2-metrics-glossary.md` in this folder to learn the core metrics you will see across OKRs, dashboards, and reviews. When something is important or confusing, follow the links there into the full metrics frameworks under `02-Methods-and-Tools/`.

8. **Get the language for acronyms**  
   Use `3-acronyms.md` in this folder as a quick-reference for shorthands (OKR, PRD, JTBD, NSM, etc.) and where they are defined in the methods library. Adapt and extend this with your own organization’s acronyms over time.

9. **Know where methods and templates live**  
   The `02-Methods-and-Tools/` directory contains the frameworks and templates you will use most often (strategy, OKRs, roadmaps, discovery, PRDs, communication). When you see a method referenced in company docs, it will usually live there.

10. **Use PM Brain as a thinking partner, not just a wiki**  
   When you are working on a real problem (new initiative, roadmap decision, stakeholder conflict), bring the relevant company context docs plus the matching framework from `02-Methods-and-Tools/` into a conversation with the agent. The value comes from combining your context with these tools, not filling templates in isolation.
