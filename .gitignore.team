# PM-Brain: Team Mode
# ================================
# This template configures the repo for TEAM use - ideal for:
# - Sharing frameworks and templates with team
# - Collaborative template development
# - Keeping personal logs private
#
# What's ignored (not tracked):
# - Daily learning logs (`00-Meta/1-daily-log-*.md`)
# - Weekly/monthly reflections (`00-Meta/0.1-Learning-Log/*/`)
# - Growth portfolio entries (`00-Meta/0.2-Growth-Portfolio/*.md`)
# - Self-assessments (`00-Meta/self-assessment-*.md`)
# - Company-specific context
#
# What's tracked:
# - All templates and frameworks
# - Documentation and guides
# - Shared learning resources
# - Example initiatives (as references)
#
# To activate this mode:
#   cat .gitignore.team >> .gitignore
#   git add .gitignore
#   git commit -m "setup: Switch to team mode"
