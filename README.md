> **Your external product management brain. Single source of truth = latest commit.**

A living knowledge base that bridges the gap between Product Management frameworks and actual operational execution. Git-versioned, shareable, ready to use.

**Product teams drown in blog posts and frameworks** but don't know *how* to run sprint planning on Tuesday morning or write a strategy document by end-of-day. This gives you battle-tested guides, templates, and playbooks. Built for everyone from junior PMs to senior leads.

🚀 **Get started:** clone the repo → add your context → start shipping

## 🚀 How to Get Started

> **New to this repository?** Start with [`SETUP.md`](./SETUP.md) for detailed setup instructions, including how to customize Company Context, configure AI tools, and get started with your first framework.

### Option 1: Manual (Copy-Paste into AI Tools)

**Best for:** ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Microsoft Copilot, or other chat-based AI tools.

1. **Browse** to the folder you need:
   - `01-Company-Context/` – for company strategy, vision, stakeholders
   - `02-Methods-and-Tools/` – for frameworks, guides, templates, playbooks
   - `03-Research-Artifacts/` – for research storage structure
   - `04-Initiatives/` – for opportunity assessments and initiative planning

2. **Before using templates: Braindump first**
   - Don't jump straight to filling templates. Start by dumping your thoughts, ideas, and concerns.
   - Use the braindumping prompts in each framework to capture your raw thinking first.
   - Let your product sense and intuition guide initial thoughts before structuring them.

3. **Copy** the relevant README + template files.

4. **Paste** into your AI chat session with a prompt like:
   ```
   Here's the structure I use for [product strategy / PRDs / OKRs / etc.].
   
   First, help me braindump my thoughts on [topic]. Quiz me, challenge my assumptions, and help me think through this before we structure it.
   
   Then help me fill it out / adapt it for [my context].
   ```
4. **Save for reuse** (recommended):
   - Upload files to your AI tool's project feature (ChatGPT's "My GPTs", Claude's "Projects", etc.)
   - Or save the conversation for future reference
   - Reuse templates without re-copying each time

### Option 2: Technical (Clone & Use with IDE AI Tools)

**Best for:** GitHub users with VS Code, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Replit, or similar IDE AI tools.

1. **Clone** the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/andreaskelm/pm-brain.git
   cd pm-brain
   ```

2. **Plug in your context:**
   - Replace placeholders in `01-Company-Context/` with your actual vision, strategy, principles
   - Customize templates in `02-Methods-and-Tools/` for your workflows

3. **Start using (think first, structure second):**
   - **Braindump before structuring**: Use the braindumping prompts in each framework to capture your raw thoughts first
   - **Develop product sense**: Use the product sense exercises and reflection prompts to build judgment
   - **Think critically**: Let frameworks guide your thinking, not replace it. Answer the quiz questions honestly.
   - Use frameworks and guides in `02-Methods-and-Tools/` for daily work
   - Store research in `03-Research-Artifacts/`
   - Document initiatives in `04-Initiatives/`

4. **Optional:** Point your IDE's AI tools at this repo as project context.

## 🏗️ System Structure Philosophy

This is a **PM brain-as-code**, not a random notes folder. The directories represent different **types of work** and **layers of your product system**, not a rigid sequential process.

> **📖 Want to know more about how to use this system?** See [`GUIDELINES.md`](./GUIDELINES.md) for best practices on linking to external sources, collaboration, and maintaining your PM brain.

### Four Core Layers

```text
pm-brain/
├── 01-Company-Context/        # 🏢 Strategic foundation (vision, strategy, metrics, stakeholders)
├── 02-Methods-and-Tools/      # 🧭 PM operating system (frameworks, guides, templates, prompts)
├── 03-Research-Artifacts/     # 🔍 Evidence layer (interview notes, synthesis, findings)
└── 04-Initiatives/            # 🚧 Active bets (early thinking, opportunity assessments, docs)
```

### Optional Layers

```text
├── 08-Prototypes/             # 🧪 Experiments and prototype implementations
└── 09-Personal-Context/       # 🧑 Personal notes (keep sensitive content in private fork)
```

## 🧠 Product Sense Development System

**NEW: `00-Meta/` - Your PM growth engine**

Before you can effectively use frameworks, you need to develop deep product thinking. The `00-Meta/` folder is your personal product sense training system.

### The Golden Rule: Braindump Before Structure

**Read first:** [`PRODUCT-SENSE-RULES.md`](./PRODUCT-SENSE-RULES.md)

Before opening any template or framework:
1. **Braindump your raw thinking** (10-15 min)
2. **Use the prompts** in `02-Methods-and-Tools/2.0-Foundations/2.0.1-Mental-Models/6-Product-Sense-Development/2-product-sense-template.md`
3. **Then** structure using frameworks from `02-Methods-and-Tools/`

**Why this matters:** Frameworks organize thinking. They don't create it. Think deeply first, then structure.

### 3-Layer Architecture

```text
Layer 1: How to Think (00-Meta/)
   ↓
Layer 2: How to Execute (02-Methods-and-Tools/)
   ↓
Layer 3: What You're Building (04-Initiatives/)
```

**Without Layer 1:** You're just filling out templates.  
**With Layer 1:** You're developing deep product judgment.

### What's in `00-Meta/`

- **Daily Practice** (10 min): Exercises to build product intuition
- **Monthly Assessment** (30 min): Track your growth trajectory
- **Learning Log**: Weekly reflections and monthly syntheses
- **Growth Portfolio**: Evidence for 1:1s and performance reviews

### Quick Start with Product Sense

**Choose your mode (public/private/team):**
```bash
# Run interactive setup
bash 00-Meta/SETUP.sh
# Select mode: public (default), private, or team

# Or read mode guide first
cat 00-Meta/MODE-SELECTION-GUIDE.md
```

**Modes:**
- **🌍 Public** (default): Everything tracked (great for portfolios)
- **🔒 Private**: Only frameworks tracked (personal learning)
- **👥 Team**: Share frameworks, keep logs private

**5-minute setup:**
```bash
# Read the golden rule
cat PRODUCT-SENSE-RULES.md

# Start your daily log (copy the canonical template)
cp 02-Methods-and-Tools/2.0-Foundations/2.0.1-Mental-Models/6-Product-Sense-Development/templates/daily-log-template.md 00-Meta/1-daily-log-2026-Q1.md

# Do one 10-min exercise
# Open: 02-Methods-and-Tools/2.0-Foundations/2.0.1-Mental-Models/6-Product-Sense-Development/templates/1-daily-practice-exercises.md
```

**Daily workflow:**
- Morning: Remember to braindump before using frameworks
- During day: Log significant decisions
- End of day: 5-min daily log update
- Sunday evening: 30-min weekly reflection

**See [`00-Meta/README.md`](./00-Meta/README.md) for complete guide.**

## 🔄 Daily Workflow

1. **Reference** `01-Company-Context/` for strategic direction and company information.
2. **Use** `02-Methods-and-Tools/` when you need a process, framework, template, or playbook.
3. **Store** research outputs in `03-Research-Artifacts/` after completing discovery work.
4. **Do** your active product work in `04-Initiatives/` (planning, documenting, iterating).

### How Frameworks Work Together

The frameworks follow a natural product development flow:

**0. Early Thinking** (`04-Initiatives/`) → Capture ideas and hypotheses

**1. Discover** (`2.2-Discovery/`) → Interview users, observe behavior, collect stories

**2. Define** (`2.2.3-Jobs-To-Be-Done/`) → Frame problems as jobs and opportunities

**3. Assess** (`2.2.4-Opportunity-Assessment/`) → Document and assess opportunities

**4. Decide** (`2.2.5-Idea-Validation/`) → Generate solutions and validate assumptions

**5. Deliver** (`2.3-Execution/2.3.4-PRD/`) → Write requirements and build

**6. Launch & Learn** (`2.1-Strategy/2.1.2-Strategic-Execution/1-OKR/` and `2.1-Strategy/2.1.2-Strategic-Execution/2-Roadmap/`) → Measure outcomes and iterate

See `02-Methods-and-Tools/README.md` for complete navigation guide.
