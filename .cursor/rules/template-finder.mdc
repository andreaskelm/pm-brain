description: When the user explicitly asks to write, draft, or fill in a specific doc (PRD, one-pager, OKR, opportunity assessment, roadmap, meeting agenda, newsletter, crisis comms), route to the template finder instead of forcing the full product-sense braindump loop.

# Template Finder Path

When the user says they want to **write**, **draft**, or **fill in** a specific document—e.g. "write a PRD", "draft a one-pager", "I need the OKR template", "fill in the opportunity assessment", "create a meeting agenda", "need the roadmap template"—treat it as a **template-first** request.

1. **Point to** [02-Methods-and-Tools/0-template-finder.md](02-Methods-and-Tools/0-template-finder.md) and, from the table there, open the README + template for the doc they asked for.
2. **One-line nudge:** "If you haven't thought it through yet, [0-start-here-product-thinking.md](02-Methods-and-Tools/2.0-Foundations/2.0.1-Mental-Models/6-Product-Sense-Development/0-start-here-product-thinking.md) is there for a braindump first."
3. **Do not** run the full product-sense flow (multiple prompts, no framework until braindump) unless they then say they want to think it through first.
4. For non-trivial docs (PRD, Strategy, Opportunity Assessment, Roadmap), this path **overrides the full product_sense loop** but you **must ask** 2–3 preflight prompts before diving into the template. Required prompts: "Why this, why now?", "What do you already know vs. what are you guessing?", "Who is this for?" (if not clear). For trivial docs (meeting agenda, newsletter), preflight is optional.
5. **For frameworks with evaluation support (OKRs, roadmaps, PRDs, opportunity assessments, North Star, one-pagers):** During creation, automatically use lightweight quality checks (see `.cursor/rules/evaluation-orchestration.mdc`). Scan for red flags as the user creates, point out issues inline, and offer full evaluation after completion.
