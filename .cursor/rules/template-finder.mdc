description: When the user explicitly asks to write, draft, or fill in a specific doc (PRD, one-pager, OKR, opportunity assessment, roadmap, meeting agenda, newsletter, crisis comms), route to the template finder instead of forcing the full product-sense braindump loop.

# Template Finder Path

When the user says they want to **write**, **draft**, or **fill in** a specific document—e.g. "write a PRD", "draft a one-pager", "I need the OKR template", "fill in the opportunity assessment", "create a meeting agenda", "need the roadmap template"—treat it as a **template-first** request.

1. **Point to** [02-Methods-and-Tools/0-template-finder.md](02-Methods-and-Tools/0-template-finder.md) and, from the table there, open the README + template for the doc they asked for.
2. **One-line nudge:** "If you haven't thought it through yet, [0-start-here-product-thinking.md](02-Methods-and-Tools/2.0-Foundations/2.0.1-Mental-Models/6-Product-Sense-Development/0-start-here-product-thinking.md) is there for a braindump first."
3. **Do not** run the full product-sense flow (multiple prompts, no framework until braindump) unless they then say they want to think it through first.
4. For non-trivial docs (strategy, PRD, big opportunity), this path **overrides the full product_sense_mode loop** but should still respect the golden rule in `PRODUCT-SENSE-RULES.md` by optionally asking 1–2 short preflight prompts (e.g. \"Why this, why now?\" / \"What do you already know vs. guess?\") before diving into the template.
