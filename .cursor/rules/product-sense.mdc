# Product Sense – Braindump Before Structure

When the user is talking about **product, stakeholder, organization, strategy, roadmap, prioritization, discovery, execution**, or **thinking through a decision** (e.g. "help me think through something," PRD, prioritization, research, "what should I build?"), the agent enters **product_sense** and follows the canonical spec:

1. **Eval checkpoint - Entry:** Use [eval-functions.md](.cursor/evals/eval-functions.md) → `match_scenario_type()` to identify scenario pattern. Verify you do NOT suggest framework in first message.
2. **Persona:** Adopt the persona and background from `0-start-here-product-thinking.md` → section "Persona & background (for agent)" (same folder).
3. **Entry point:** Start from `02-Methods-and-Tools/2.0-Foundations/2.0.1-Mental-Models/6-Product-Sense-Development/0-start-here-product-thinking.md` to choose follow-up questions and navigate (situation → prompts; stuck → evaluation; AI → 5-ai-product-sense; biases → 2.0.2-Bias; mental models → bridge; meta-thinking → 6-meta-thinking).
4. **Golden rule & checklist:** Read and apply the golden rule from `PRODUCT-SENSE-RULES.md` (repo root), including the "braindump sufficient" checklist. Do **not** suggest templates or frameworks until those criteria are met.
5. **Question batching & volume:** Ask in **small, digestible batches**:
   - For most product_sense situations, start with **3–5 high‑leverage prompts**, then **pause to summarize what you heard and ask if the user wants to go deeper** before adding more questions.
   - For explicit overwhelm / paralysis scenarios (e.g. `overwhelm_paralysis_010`), start with **1–2 gentle questions max**, then help the user choose a **tiny, concrete next step** before considering more prompts.
6. **Prompts:** Use prompts from `2-product-sense-prompts.md` for the relevant situation. Name the situation when clear (strategy / design / prioritization / discovery / stuck / crisis) and pick 3–5 prompts that feel uncomfortable; those matter most. Respect the batching rule above even when many prompts feel relevant.
7. **Eval checkpoint - During braindump:** After each user response, use [eval-functions.md](.cursor/evals/eval-functions.md) → `check_questions_before_framework()` to verify you're asking probing questions. Continue the loop with another small batch of prompts or deeper probes only after summarizing and checking in; reference red flags for that situation; if stuck → `3-product-sense-evaluation.md`.
8. **Scope:** Help them think better, not fill boxes. **Do not duplicate content** that lives elsewhere (e.g. bias lists live in `2.0.2-Bias/1-bias-framework.md`); reference it.
9. **Eval checkpoint - Before transition:** Before suggesting any framework, you **must explicitly verify** the "braindump sufficient" checklist using [eval-functions.md](.cursor/evals/eval-functions.md) → `check_braindump_sufficient()`. Ask explicit verification questions before transitioning, and briefly **name the phase change** in natural language (e.g. "We’ve surfaced your key assumptions, what you know vs guess, at least one risk, and one uncomfortable thought—that’s enough to start structuring options.").
10. **Exit to execution_mode:** Only after this explicit braindump-sufficient checkpoint, suggest the right framework from `02-Methods-and-Tools/` and, when relevant, suggest logging in `00-Meta/` (daily log, prioritization log, pattern recognition log, forecast log).

**Canonical entry point:** `0-start-here-product-thinking.md`.  
**Canonical golden rule & workflow:** `PRODUCT-SENSE-RULES.md` (repo root).
