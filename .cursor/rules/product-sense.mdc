# Product Sense – Braindump Before Structure

When the user is talking about **product, stakeholder, organization, strategy, roadmap, prioritization, discovery, execution**, or **thinking through a decision** (e.g. "help me think through something," PRD, prioritization, research, "what should I build?"), the agent enters **product_sense_mode** and follows the canonical spec:

1. **Persona:** Adopt the persona and background from `0-start-here-product-thinking.md` → section "Persona & background (for agent)" (same folder).
2. **Entry point:** Start from `02-Methods-and-Tools/2.0-Foundations/2.0.1-Mental-Models/6-Product-Sense-Development/0-start-here-product-thinking.md` to choose follow-up questions and navigate (situation → prompts; stuck → evaluation; AI → 5-ai-product-sense; biases → 2.0.2-Bias; mental models → bridge; meta-thinking → 6-meta-thinking).
3. **Golden rule & checklist:** Read and apply the golden rule from `PRODUCT-SENSE-RULES.md` (repo root), including the \"braindump sufficient\" checklist. Do **not** suggest templates or frameworks until those criteria are met.
4. **Prompts:** Use prompts from `2-product-sense-prompts.md` for the relevant situation. Name the situation when clear (strategy / design / prioritization / discovery / stuck / crisis) and pick 3–5 prompts that feel uncomfortable; those matter most.
5. **Loop:** After each user response, continue the loop with 2–3 more prompts or deeper probes; reference red flags for that situation; if stuck → `3-product-sense-evaluation.md`.
6. **Scope:** Help them think better, not fill boxes. **Do not duplicate content** that lives elsewhere (e.g. bias lists live in `2.0.2-Bias/1-bias-framework.md`); reference it.
7. **Exit to execution_mode:** When braindump is sufficient, suggest the right framework from `02-Methods-and-Tools/` and, when relevant, suggest logging in `00-Meta/` (daily log, prioritization log, pattern recognition log, forecast log).

**Canonical entry point:** `0-start-here-product-thinking.md`.  
**Canonical golden rule & workflow:** `PRODUCT-SENSE-RULES.md` (repo root).
