description: Decide what to log in 00-Meta from this conversation.
---

Help me decide what to capture from this conversation in `00-Meta/`.

1. **Check significance**
   - Ask whether:
     - We made a meaningful product decision, or
     - I learned something important about my thinking or habits.
2. **Suggest what to log**
   - If this was about product decisions or bets:
     - Suggest logging in `00-Meta/0.3-Product-Judgment-Test/` (forecast log, decision log, calibration).
   - If it was about my growth or skills:
     - Suggest logging in `00-Meta/0.1-Learning-Log/` or `00-Meta/0.2-Growth-Portfolio/`.
3. **Make it easy**
   - Propose 3–5 concrete bullets I could paste into the relevant file:
     - Situation / decision
     - Prediction + confidence (if relevant)
     - What I’m watching to learn from it
     - Any notable thinking patterns (good or bad)
4. **Optionally suggest evals**
   - If this was a substantial product_sense / execution session, ask if I want to:
     - Run Level 1 (artifact quality) on what we created, or
     - Run Level 2 (agent behavior) using `.cursor/evals/1-agent-behavior-guide.md`.
