# Bias check

Run a pre-decision bias check. Identify likely biases affecting this decision, suggest mitigations, and point to debiasing actions. Having biases is normal; the goal is awareness and systematic debiasing, not perfection.

**Reference:** @02-Methods-and-Tools/2.0-Foundations/2.0.2-Bias/1-bias-framework.md — use it for the full checklist, top 10 PM biases, and output format.

**Output:** Biases detected (with severity), mitigations, debiasing actions, and where to record the decision (e.g. @04-Initiatives/[INITIATIVE]/decisions.md).

**When to use:** Before strategic decisions, resource allocation, go/no-go, major feature or pricing decisions, and estimates.
