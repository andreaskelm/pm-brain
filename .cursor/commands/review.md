# Review for PM Brain alignment

Review the current selection or open document for completeness and alignment with PM Brain frameworks. Check: structure, missing sections, alignment with templates and evaluation criteria.

**Reference:** @02-Methods-and-Tools/0-Template-Structure and, if the doc is a PRD, opportunity assessment, OKR, roadmap, North Star, or one-pager, the relevant 3-*-evaluation.md in that framework folder.

**Check for:** Typos, broken references/links, incomplete logic, template alignment, and that required sections exist.

**Output:** Looks good (items that pass), issues found (severity + file:line + suggested fix), and summary (files reviewed, critical/warning counts). Severity: CRITICAL (security, data loss), HIGH (bugs, bad UX), MEDIUM (quality, maintainability), LOW (style).
