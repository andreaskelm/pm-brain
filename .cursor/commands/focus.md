# Focus Task

Priority assessment and context-switching management. Use Eisenhower Matrix, deep work principles, and LNO framework to maximize impact.

## Your Current Situation

Answer these first:
- How many initiatives/projects are you juggling?
- How much of your time is meetings vs. focused work?
- What's preventing you from working on what matters most?
- When was the last time you had 2+ hours of uninterrupted work?

## Eisenhower Matrix Assessment

Sort your tasks into four quadrants:

### QUADRANT I: Urgent & Important (DO NOW)
**Examples:**
- Production outages
- Critical bugs blocking customers
- Deadline today/tomorrow
- Crisis management

**Action:** Do immediately, but design systems to reduce these

### QUADRANT II: Not Urgent but Important (SCHEDULE FIRST)
**Examples:**
- Strategic planning
- Discovery/research
- Building relationships
- Process improvements
- Learning/growth

**Action:** Protect time for these! This is where real impact happens

### QUADRANT III: Urgent but Not Important (DELEGATE/MINIMIZE)
**Examples:**
- Most interruptions
- Some meetings
- Other people's priorities
- Email/Slack responses

**Action:** Delegate, set rules, time-box, or decline

### QUADRANT IV: Not Urgent & Not Important (DROP/AUTOMATE)
**Examples:**
- Busy work
- Vanity metrics
- Unnecessary reports
- Time wasters

**Action:** Stop doing these. Automate or eliminate

## Deep Work vs Shallow Work

### Deep Work (Protect This)
**Characteristics:**
- Requires focus and cognitive effort
- Creates reusable assets
- Changes decisions or outcomes
- Can't be done in meetings

**Examples:**
- Writing strategy docs
- PRDs and requirements
- Data analysis and synthesis
- Design thinking
- Complex problem solving

**Time needed:** 2-4 hour blocks

### Shallow Work (Batch This)
**Characteristics:**
- Coordination and communication
- Administrative tasks
- Can be interrupted
- Doesn't require deep thinking

**Examples:**
- Responding to Slack/email
- Status updates
- Quick questions
- Meeting attendance
- Calendar management

**Time needed:** 30-60 min batches

Reference: @02-Methods-and-Tools/2.0-Foundations/2.0.1-Mental-Models/4-Execution-Hygiene/1-deep-work-shallow-work.md

## LNO Framework: Leverage, Neutral, Overhead

### Leverage Activities (Maximize)
**What:** Work that creates disproportionate value
- Unblocking others
- Strategic decisions
- Process improvements
- Relationship building
- Multiplier effects

**Target:** 40-50% of time

### Neutral Activities (Optimize)
**What:** Necessary but doesn't multiply impact
- Routine meetings
- Status updates
- Standard execution work

**Target:** 30-40% of time

### Overhead Activities (Minimize)
**What:** Necessary evils, pure coordination
- Administrative work
- Reports
- Compliance tasks
- Calendar management

**Target:** <20% of time

Reference: @02-Methods-and-Tools/2.0-Foundations/2.0.1-Mental-Models/4-Execution-Hygiene/3-lno-framework.md

## Focus Time Protection Strategy

### Block Your Calendar

**Weekly time blocking:**
```
MONDAY
9-11am: DEEP WORK - [Q2 task]
11-12pm: SHALLOW - Meetings/email
1-3pm: DEEP WORK - [Q2 task]
3-4pm: SHALLOW - Team sync

TUESDAY
9-11am: DEEP WORK - [Q2 task]
11-1pm: MEETINGS
1-2pm: SHALLOW - Inbox/Slack
2-4pm: DEEP WORK - [Q2 task]

[Continue for week...]
```

**Protection tactics:**
```
☐ Block 2-3 deep work sessions per day
☐ Mark as "Busy" on calendar
☐ Add title: "Focus Time - Do Not Book"
☐ Decline meetings during these blocks
☐ Set Slack status: "🎯 Focus time until [X]"
☐ Close email and Slack
☐ Turn off notifications
☐ Use headphones (signal to team)
```

### Set Boundaries

**Communication templates:**

**"Can't make that meeting time":**
> "I have focus time blocked then. I have [other times] available, or I can review the recording/notes afterward."

**"Async instead of meeting":**
> "Could we do this async? Here's what I need: [specifics]. I'll respond by [time]."

**"Interruption boundary":**
> "I'm in focus time until 2pm. If it's urgent, interrupt me. Otherwise, I'll respond at 2pm."

## Context Switching Management

### Map Your Context Zones

If managing multiple initiatives:

```markdown
## My Context Zones

### ZONE 1: [Initiative A]
- Time allocation: 40%
- Status: [Phase]
- Key people: [Stakeholders]
- Next milestone: [Date]

### ZONE 2: [Initiative B]
- Time allocation: 30%
- Status: [Phase]
- Key people: [Stakeholders]
- Next milestone: [Date]

### ZONE 3: BAU/Operations
- Time allocation: 20%
- Includes: Metrics, team management, customer feedback

### ZONE 4: Strategic/Future
- Time allocation: 10%
- Includes: Discovery, planning, relationships
```

### Time-Block by Context

**Don't mix contexts:**
```
MONDAY
9-11am: ZONE 1 (Initiative A deep work)
11-12pm: ZONE 3 (BAU - metrics, team)
1-3pm: ZONE 2 (Initiative B meetings)
3-4pm: ZONE 3 (Inbox/admin)
```

**Context switch ritual (5 min between zones):**
```
CLOSE previous context:
☐ Capture where you left off
☐ Document next steps
☐ Close related tabs/docs
☐ Clear mental state

OPEN next context:
☐ Review where you left off
☐ Check priority for this context
☐ Open relevant documents
☐ Set intention
```

Reference: @02-Methods-and-Tools/2.3-Execution/2.3.1-Daily-Execution-And-Rituals/3-context-switching.md

## Triage Framework

### Interrupt Decision Tree

```
New request comes in...

Is this actually urgent?
├─ NO → Add to appropriate context zone, handle later
└─ YES → Can it wait until my next context switch?
    ├─ YES → Schedule for next appropriate time block
    └─ NO → Must handle now
        1. Close current context properly
        2. Handle interruption
        3. Decide: Return to previous context or move on?
```

### Response Templates

**Not urgent:**
> "Adding this to my [Context X] time tomorrow. Will update you by EOD tomorrow."

**Can wait 2 hours:**
> "I'm in focused work until 2pm. Can we discuss at 2:15? If it can't wait, call me."

**Truly urgent:**
> "On it. Give me 5 min to wrap what I'm doing, then I'm fully on this."

## Priority Scoring (When Everything Feels Urgent)

Use RICE scoring for quick prioritization:

```
Score = (Reach × Impact × Confidence) / Effort

Reach: How many people/teams affected?
Impact: How much impact? (3=massive, 2=high, 1=medium, 0.5=low)
Confidence: How confident? (100%=1.0, 80%=0.8, 50%=0.5)
Effort: Person-weeks of effort

Sort by score, do top 3-5.
```

- [ ] Cancel [X] meeting (move to async)
- [ ] Delegate [task] to [person]
- [ ] Stop doing [Q4 task]
- [ ] Set up focus time blocks on calendar
- [ ] Communicate boundaries to team

**Boundaries to Set:**
- "Focus time 9-11am daily - interrupt only for [criteria]"
- "Async-first for [type of request]"
- "Meeting-free [day/time block]"

**To Decline/Reduce:**
- [Meeting that can be async]
- [Report that adds no value]
- [Task that's Q3 or Q4]

---

## Integration with Other Commands

- **Daily:** Use /day command with protected focus blocks
- **Weekly:** Use /week for weekly time allocation review
- **Stuck on priorities:** Use prioritization framework: @02-Methods-and-Tools/2.1-Strategy/2.1.2-Strategic-Execution/4-Prioritization
- **Too many initiatives:** Use /unstuck for diagnosis

## Effectiveness Metrics

**Track weekly:**
- Deep work hours: [X] (Target: 15-20)
- Focus blocks protected: [X]% (Target: >80%)
- Meetings declined/delegated: [X]
- Q4 tasks eliminated: [X]

**Monthly review:**
- Is deep work increasing?
- Are Q2 activities getting time?
- Is overhead decreasing?
- Adjust strategy based on results

## Common Scenarios

**"My calendar is 100% meetings"**
- Audit all meetings: which can be cancelled, async, or delegated?
- Block focus time 2 weeks in advance
- Set "no meeting" blocks (e.g., Tue/Thu mornings)
- Say no more: @02-Methods-and-Tools/2.4-Communication/2.4.6-Saying-No

**"Constant interruptions on Slack"**
- Set clear status during focus time
- Turn off Slack notifications
- Set expectations: "I check Slack at 12pm and 4pm"
- Create async-first culture

**"Everything feels urgent"**
- Use Eisenhower Matrix - most "urgent" is Q3
- Ask: "What happens if I don't do this today?"
- Push back: "Help me understand the urgency"
- Escalate if needed: @02-Methods-and-Tools/2.4-Communication/2.4.5-Escalation

**"I have 5 initiatives and can't focus"**
- Map context zones
- Time-block by context
- Consider: Should you have 5 initiatives?
