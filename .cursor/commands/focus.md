# Focus and prioritization

Prioritize and protect focus: Eisenhower Matrix, deep work vs shallow work, context zones if juggling multiple initiatives. Identify what to do now, schedule, delegate, or drop.

**Reference:** @02-Methods-and-Tools/2.0-Foundations/2.0.1-Mental-Models/4-Execution-Hygiene/ and @02-Methods-and-Tools/2.3-Execution/2.3.1-Daily-Execution-And-Rituals/3-context-switching.md — use them for matrices, LNO framework, and time-blocking.

**Output:** Quadrant sort (urgent/important), protected deep-work blocks, boundaries to set, and what to decline or defer.

**Related:** Use /day with protected focus blocks; use /week for weekly time allocation; use /unstuck if too many initiatives.
