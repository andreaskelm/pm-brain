# Unstuck Task

Diagnostic tool to identify where you're blocked and suggest specific solutions. Maps symptoms to root causes, then recommends frameworks and actions.

## Diagnostic Questions

Answer these to identify your block:

### About Your Situation
- What specifically feels stuck or unclear?
- How long have you been stuck on this?

**A) Direction unclear** - Don't know what to build or why
**B) Too many priorities** - Everything feels urgent, nothing moves forward
**C) No customer insight** - Building in the dark, no validation
**D) Stakeholder misalignment** - Politics, conflicting opinions, no buy-in

### 🔄 If Still Stuck After This
- Try: /navigate to find different approach
- Escalate: @02-Methods-and-Tools/2.4-Communication/2.4.5-Escalation
- Reflect: @02-Methods-and-Tools/2.0-Foundations/2.0.3-Self-Reflection

## Multiple Issues?

If you have multiple symptoms from different categories:

1. **Prioritize root cause** - Usually one underlying issue
2. **Start with Foundations** (2.0) - Often fixes multiple symptoms
3. **Build rhythm first** - Use /day and /week before complex frameworks
4. **One change at a time** - Don't try to fix everything simultaneously

**Common combinations:**
- A + D (Direction unclear + Stakeholder misalignment) → Fix strategy first
- B + E (Too many priorities + Execution chaos) → Fix prioritization and rhythm
- C + F (No customer insight + Decision paralysis) → Start customer interviews
```
