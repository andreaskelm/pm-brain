# Unstuck diagnostic

Diagnose where the user is blocked: direction unclear, too many priorities, no customer insight, stakeholder misalignment, execution chaos, decision paralysis, or team dysfunction. Recommend frameworks and next actions (this week + next 2 weeks).

**Reference:** @02-Methods-and-Tools/2.0-Foundations/2.0.1-Mental-Models/6-Product-Sense-Development/3-product-sense-evaluation.md and the relevant 2.x sections (Strategy, Discovery, Execution, Communication). Use the full framework docs for detailed solutions per category.

**Symptom categories (short):** A) Direction unclear → strategy, OKRs, pre-mortem; use /bias, /start if new initiative. B) Too many priorities → Eisenhower, prioritization, saying no; use /focus, /day, /week. C) No customer insight → research, JTBD; use /bias (confirmation). D) Stakeholder misalignment → stakeholder map, one-pager, escalation. E) Execution chaos → focus, daily rituals, context switching; use /focus, /day. F) Decision paralysis → bias check, pre-mortem, one-way/two-way doors; use /bias. G) Team dysfunction → context zones, ownership, disagree-and-commit.

**Output:** Primary issue and root cause, symptoms present, action plan (this week must-do, next 2 weeks), commands/frameworks to use, potential biases to check.

**If still stuck:** Use /navigate for a different approach; consider escalation or self-reflection frameworks.
