# Navigate to the right framework

From the user's situation, recommend the right phase and framework(s). Ask 1–2 diagnostic questions if needed, then point to the right path in 02-Methods-and-Tools.

**Reference:** @02-Methods-and-Tools/0-template-finder.md and the flow: 2.0 Foundations → 2.1 Strategy → 2.2 Discovery → 2.3 Execution → 2.4 Communication.

**Quick routing:**
- Don't know what to build / need customers → 2.2 Discovery (research, JTBD, opportunity assessment)
- Need direction / strategy → 2.1 Strategy (foundations, OKRs, roadmap, prioritization)
- Ready to build / specify → 2.3 Execution (PRD, personas, metrics); use /day and /week for rhythm
- Align stakeholders / communication → 2.4 Communication (newsletter, agendas, stakeholder management)
- Stuck / overwhelmed → 2.0 Foundations (mental models, bias, self-reflection); use /bias, /focus
- Starting new initiative → /start
- Too many priorities → 2.1.2/4-Prioritization; use /focus

**Output:** Current phase, primary framework path, 1–2 supporting frameworks, and where to save work (e.g. 04-Initiatives).
