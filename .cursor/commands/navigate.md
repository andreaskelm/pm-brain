# Navigate Task

Intelligent router to find the right PM framework for your current situation. Ask diagnostic questions, then recommend specific paths in @02-Methods-and-Tools .

## Your Current Context

Ask yourself:
- What are you trying to accomplish right now?
- Where are you stuck or unclear?
- What phase of work are you in?

## Decision Tree

Based on your answers, determine the right framework:

### If: "I don't know what to build" or "Need to understand customers"
→ **Discovery Phase**
- Start: @02-Methods-and-Tools/2.2-Discovery/2.2.1-Research-Interviews
- Then: @02-Methods-and-Tools/2.2-Discovery/2.2.3-Jobs-To-Be-Done
- Structure: @02-Methods-and-Tools/2.2-Discovery/2.2.2-Continuous-Discovery-Habits

### If: "Need to set direction" or "No clear strategy"
→ **Strategy Phase**
- Foundations: @02-Methods-and-Tools/2.1-Strategy/2.1.1-Strategic-Foundations
- Goals: @02-Methods-and-Tools/2.1-Strategy/2.1.2-Strategic-Execution/1-OKR
- Planning: @02-Methods-and-Tools/2.1-Strategy/2.1.2-Strategic-Execution/2-Roadmap

### If: "Ready to build" or "Need to specify requirements"
→ **Execution Phase**
- Requirements: @02-Methods-and-Tools/2.3-Execution/2.3.4-PRD
- Users: @02-Methods-and-Tools/2.3-Execution/2.3.5-Personas
- Measurement: @02-Methods-and-Tools/2.3-Execution/2.3.6-Metrics
- Daily rhythm: Use /day and /week commands

### If: "Need to align stakeholders" or "Communication breakdown"
→ **Communication Phase**
- Updates: @02-Methods-and-Tools/2.4-Communication/2.4.1-Newsletter
- Meetings: @02-Methods-and-Tools/2.4-Communication/2.4.2-Meeting-Agendas
- Management: @02-Methods-and-Tools/2.4-Communication/2.4.7-Stakeholder-Management

### If: "Stuck" or "Making bad decisions" or "Overwhelmed"
→ **Foundations Phase**
- Check biases: Use /bias command
- Improve focus: Use /focus command
- Mental models: @02-Methods-and-Tools/2.0-Foundations/2.0.1-Mental-Models
- Reflect: @02-Methods-and-Tools/2.0-Foundations/2.0.3-Self-Reflection

### If: "Starting a new initiative"
→ Use /start command for full orchestration

### If: "Too many priorities" or "Don't know what to focus on"
→ **Prioritization**
- Framework: @02-Methods-and-Tools/2.1-Strategy/2.1.2-Strategic-Execution/4-Prioritization
- Decision tree: @02-Methods-and-Tools/2.1-Strategy/2.1.2-Strategic-Execution/4-Prioritization/decision-tree.md
- Daily: Use /focus command

### If: "Have an early idea to explore"
→ **Opportunity Assessment**
- Framework: @02-Methods-and-Tools/2.2-Discovery/2.2.4-Opportunity-Assessment
- Storage: @04-Initiatives (create new initiative folder)
