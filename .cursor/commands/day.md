# Day planning

Plan today: morning check (fire drill, commitments, focus list), midday check, evening wrap (close loops, prep tomorrow). Protect at least one 2-hour focus block.

**Reference:** @02-Methods-and-Tools/2.3-Execution/2.3.1-Daily-Execution-And-Rituals/1-daily-rituals.md — use it for the full routine, checklists, and output format.

**Output:** Today's focus (must-do list, focus time block), fire check, meetings, and evening wrap items.

**Related:** Use /focus if priorities are unclear; use /bias before major decisions during the day; use /week for end-of-week wrap.
