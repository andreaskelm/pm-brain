# Day Task

Daily execution planning and focus. Structure your day to maximize deep work, handle commitments, and maintain momentum.

## Daily Operating System

Plan your day in three phases: Morning routine → Midday check → Evening wrap-up

Reference: @02-Methods-and-Tools/2.3-Execution/2.3.1-Daily-Execution-And-Rituals/1-daily-rituals.md

## Morning Routine (30-45 min)

**Best Time:** First thing, before meetings

### STEP 1: Check Critical Signals (10 min)

Check in this order:

```
☐ Production/System Health
- Status dashboards
- Overnight incidents?
- Customer-reported issues?

☐ Team Blockers
- Team Slack/async updates
- Anyone blocked?
- Anyone need urgent help?

☐ Stakeholder Requests
- Leadership emails
- Key stakeholder DMs
- Any "urgent" flags?

☐ Key Metrics
- Core metrics dashboard
- Unusual changes?
- Compare to yesterday/last week
```

**Decision:** Is anything on fire requiring immediate attention?
- YES → Handle the fire, then resume routine
- NO → Continue to Step 2

### STEP 2: Review Today's Commitments (10 min)

```
☐ What meetings do I have today?
- Can any be cancelled/shortened?
- What prep is needed?
- What decisions need to be made?

☐ What MUST get done today?
- Commitments to others
- Deadlines
- Promised follow-ups

☐ What can wait if needed?
- Important but not urgent
- Can be delegated
- Can move to tomorrow
```

### STEP 3: Create Today's Focus List (10 min)

Maximum 3-5 items:

```markdown
## Today: [Date]

### MUST DO (Committed)
1. [Task] - [Time estimate] - [Why it matters]
2. [Task] - [Time estimate] - [Why it matters]

### SHOULD DO (High Value)
3. [Task] - [Time estimate]
4. [Task] - [Time estimate]

### COULD DO (If Time)
5. [Task] - [Time estimate]

### DELEGATE/DEFER
- [What I'm moving or giving to others]
```

Use /focus command if struggling to prioritize.

### STEP 4: Protect Your Focus Time (5 min)

```
☐ Block 2-hour focus block (protect this)
☐ Add 30-min buffer before big meetings
☐ Add 15-min breaks between back-to-backs

Set boundaries:
- Slack status: "🎯 Focus time until [X]"
- Close email
- Turn off notifications
- Notify team you're heads-down
```

### STEP 5: Quick Team Check-In (10 min)

```
☐ Scan team updates (async standups, Slack)
☐ Anyone blocked? Unblock them now
☐ Any wins to acknowledge?
☐ Anyone need air cover?
```

**Team message example:**

```
Morning team! 👋

Handling today:
- [Blocker you're removing]
- [Decision you're making]

Available for:
- Quick questions: Slack me
- Longer discussions: After 2pm
- Urgent: Interrupt me

Focus time: 9-11am (async unless urgent)
```

**MORNING ROUTINE COMPLETE ✅**

---

## Midday Check-In (10-15 min)

**Best Time:** Lunch or mid-afternoon (12pm-2pm)

### Progress Check

```
☐ Morning focus work: Did I complete it?
- YES → Great, what's next?
- NO → What's blocking me?

☐ Meetings so far: Any follow-ups?
- Action items to capture
- Decisions to document
- People to follow up with

☐ New issues: Changes to priorities?
- Urgent requests
- Customer escalations
- Team blockers
```

### Adjust Afternoon Plan

```
Afternoon meetings: [List them]
Available time: [Calculate between meetings]

Realistic afternoon goals:
1. [Most important thing]
2. [Second priority if time]

Moving to tomorrow:
- [What's not getting done today]
```

### Quick Communication Sweep

```
☐ Slack: Respond to anything waiting on me
☐ Email: Handle urgent (not full inbox zero)
☐ Calendar: Prep for afternoon meetings
☐ Team: Check if anyone needs help
```

---

## Evening Wrap-Up (15-20 min)

**Best Time:** Last 20 minutes of work day

### STEP 1: Close the Loop (10 min)

```
☐ Action items from today's meetings
- Captured in task system
- Scheduled or assigned

☐ Promises made
- Logged and tracked
- Follow-ups scheduled

☐ Documents/notes
- Meeting notes shared
- Decisions documented
- Key points sent to stakeholders
```

### STEP 2: Prepare Tomorrow (5 min)

```
☐ Review tomorrow's calendar
- Any prep needed tonight?
- Any conflicts to resolve?
- Any meetings to move?

☐ Create tomorrow's tentative focus list
- 3 most important things
- Based on what didn't get done today

☐ Set yourself up for success
- Documents you'll need
- Questions to think about overnight
- People to talk to
```

### STEP 3: Inbox/Slack Triage (5 min)

```
☐ Email: Get to inbox zero (or close)
- Respond to urgent
- Defer others with note
- Archive processed items

☐ Slack: Clear DMs and mentions
- Respond or acknowledge
- Snooze to tomorrow if not urgent
- Clear notification count

☐ Task list: Updated and prioritized
- Complete items checked off
- Tomorrow's items at top
- Overdue items addressed/rescheduled
```

### STEP 4: Mental Reset (2 min)

```
✅ Wins today:
- [Something you shipped/moved forward]
- [Someone you helped]
- [Problem you solved]

📝 Learn tomorrow:
- [What could have gone better]
- [What to do differently]

🧘 Let it go:
- Close computer
- Don't check Slack/email until tomorrow
- Trust your system
```

## Integration with Other Commands

- **Before day:** Use /focus if priorities unclear
- **During day:** Use /bias before major decisions
- **Multiple initiatives:** Reference context-switching guide
- **End of week:** Use /week for weekly wrap-up
- **Stuck:** Use /unstuck for diagnosis

## Context Switching (Multiple Initiatives)

If managing multiple initiatives, time-block by context:

**Example:**
```
9-11am: [Initiative A] deep work
11-12pm: [BAU] metrics review, team check-ins
1-3pm: [Initiative B] meetings
3-4pm: [BAU] inbox, admin
```
