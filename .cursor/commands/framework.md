description: Match my braindump to the right framework and template.
---

Based on what we’ve already discussed, help me find the right framework and template:

1. **Confirm my situation**
   - Briefly restate what you think my situation is (strategy, discovery, execution, communication).
   - Ask 1–2 clarifying questions if anything is ambiguous.
2. **Propose candidate frameworks**
   - Suggest 1–2 frameworks from `02-Methods-and-Tools/` that best fit.
   - For each, explain **why it fits** my situation (not just what it is).
3. **Show me where to go**
   - Point to the framework guide (`1-*-framework.md`) and, if relevant, the template (`2-*-template.md`).
4. **Preflight before drafting**
   - For non-trivial docs (PRD, Strategy, Opportunity Assessment, Roadmap), ask 2–3 preflight questions from `2-product-sense-prompts.md` (“Why this, why now?”, “Who is this for?”, “What do you know vs guess?”) before drafting.
5. **Then move into execution_mode**
   - Once we’ve picked a framework, guide me through the framework **step-by-step**, pulling from my braindump where possible.
