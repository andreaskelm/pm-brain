# Week planning

Plan the week: Monday (last-week retrospective, this-week priorities, team sync, calendar gardening), Wednesday (progress check, course correct, team pulse), Friday (retrospective, stakeholder update, prep next week).

**Reference:** @02-Methods-and-Tools/2.3-Execution/2.3.1-Daily-Execution-And-Rituals/2-weekly-cadence.md — use it for the full routine, templates, and output format.

**Output:** Week theme, Monday plan (primary goal, deliverables, focus blocks, watch items), Wednesday check-in (progress, course corrections), Friday wrap (shipped, learnings, carried over, stakeholder update).

On Friday, when you do your weekly reflection, optionally add the **“PM Brain This Week”** block from the weekly reflection template (used / frustrated / missing / one small action) so you keep lightweight feedback on how the repo and agent are working for you.

**Related:** Use /day for daily execution; use /unstuck mid-week if stuck; use /focus for priority conflicts; use /bias before major decisions.
