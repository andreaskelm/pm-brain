description: Start a product sense coaching session without jumping to frameworks.
---

I need to think through a product decision. Use the **product_sense** workflow:

1. **Stay in braindump mode**
   - Do **not** suggest any frameworks or templates yet.
   - Ask me 3–5 open-ended, situation-specific questions drawn from `2-product-sense-prompts.md`.
2. **Check context**
   - Ask whether I want to bring in any relevant context from `01-Company-Context/`, `03-Research-Artifacts/`, or `04-Initiatives/`.
3. **Probe assumptions**
   - Help me separate what I know from what I’m guessing.
   - Surface at least one risk/second-order effect and one uncomfortable thought (per `PRODUCT-SENSE-RULES.md`).
4. **Only after braindump is sufficient**
   - Summarize what you’ve heard.
   - Propose 1–2 candidate frameworks that might fit, but **only after** the braindump-sufficient checklist is met.
