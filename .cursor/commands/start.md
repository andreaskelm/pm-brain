# Start a new initiative

Launch a new initiative end-to-end. Run braindump and bias check first (PRODUCT-SENSE-RULES: think before structure), then walk through phases: early thinking → opportunity assessment → strategy alignment → discovery → PRD/roadmap → execution and communication.

**Reference:** @04-Initiatives/4.1-Initiative-Codename/ (structure), @02-Methods-and-Tools/2.2-Discovery/2.2.4-Opportunity-Assessment (early thinking), PRODUCT-SENSE-RULES.md (braindump first). Use @02-Methods-and-Tools/ for each phase's frameworks.

**Phases (high level):** 0 Braindump + bias check → 1 Foundations (mental models, pre-mortem) → 2 Early thinking (opportunity assessment, 04-Initiatives folder) → 3 Strategy alignment → 4 Discovery (research, JTBD, validation) → 5 Specify & plan (PRD, personas, metrics, roadmap) → 6 Execution & communication (daily/weekly rhythm) → 7 Validate & iterate.

**Output:** Initiative name and status, completed phases checklist, next actions (immediate + upcoming), files to create/update, watch items.

**Related:** /bias before major decisions; /focus for priority; /day and /week for rhythm; /navigate if stuck.
