# Stakeholder & Communication Skill

Use this skill when the user is focused on **alignment, communication, or politics** rather than purely on what to build.

## When to use this skill

Trigger this skill when the user:

- Says things like:
  - “How do I convince stakeholders / execs?”
  - “I need to write a one-pager / update / newsletter”
  - “I’m overwhelmed by stakeholder requests”
  - “How do I say no to this request?”
  - “How do I escalate this issue?”
- Or explicitly mentions:
  - One-pagers, newsletters, stakeholder management, saying no, escalations, crisis comms, meeting agendas.

If they’re mainly deciding **what the strategy is**, prefer `strategy-planning`. If they’re mainly figuring out **what to build**, prefer `discovery-research` or execution frameworks.

## Relevant framework locations

Most communication frameworks live under:

- `02-Methods-and-Tools/2.4-Communication/`
  - `2.4.1-Newsletter/`
  - `2.4.2-Meeting-Agendas/`
  - `2.4.3-One-Pagers/`
  - `2.4.4-Crisis-Management/`
  - `2.4.5-Escalation/`
  - `2.4.6-Saying-No/`
  - `2.4.7-Stakeholder-Management/`

## Typical flows

### 1. “Help me convince stakeholders”

1. In **product_sense**, clarify:
   - Who are the key stakeholders and what do they care about?
   - What decision or commitment are you asking them for?
   - What risks or concerns might they have?
2. Point to:
   - `2.4-Communication/2.4.7-Stakeholder-Management/1-stakeholder-management-framework.md`
   - Optionally related artifacts (e.g., one-pager) if they need a document.

### 2. “I need a one-pager / update”

1. Clarify:
   - Audience (execs, peers, cross-functional partners).
   - Purpose (decision, update, funding, alignment).
2. Use:
   - `2.4-Communication/2.4.3-One-Pagers/1-one-pager-framework.md`
   - Then, in **execution_mode**, `2-one-pager-templates.md` and `3-one-pager-evaluation.md` for quality.

### 3. “I need to say no / push back”

1. Explore:
   - What’s being requested, and by whom?
   - What constraints or tradeoffs make this hard to accept?
2. Use:
   - `2.4-Communication/2.4.6-Saying-No/1-saying-no-framework.md`
3. Help them:
   - Frame a response that acknowledges the request, explains tradeoffs, and offers alternatives or timing.

### 4. “I need to escalate / manage a crisis”

1. Clarify:
   - What’s happening, who is impacted, and what time pressure exists.
2. Use:
   - `2.4-Communication/2.4.5-Escalation/1-escalation-framework.md`
   - or `2.4-Communication/2.4.4-Crisis-Management/1-crisis-management-framework.md`
3. Help outline:
   - Situation → impact → asks → next steps, tailored to their org.

## Response guidelines

1. **Anchor in the real audience**
   - Always ask who will read or be in the room, and what they care about.
2. **Connect to upstream thinking**
   - Where relevant, bring in artifacts from `2.1-Strategy` or `2.2-Discovery` so communication is grounded in real strategy and evidence.
3. **Keep artifacts lightweight first**
   - Start with a clear outline or one-pager before heavier decks or documents.
4. **Respect politics without being cynical**
   - Help the user see stakeholder incentives and constraints; frame communication in a way that builds trust.

## Relation to other skills

- `pm-brain-workflow` orchestrates the overall flow.
- `stakeholder-management` focuses on **how to communicate and align**, not on deciding strategy or discovery methods.
- Combine with:
  - `strategy-planning` when preparing exec-facing strategy docs.
  - `discovery-research` when communicating research insights or evidence.
