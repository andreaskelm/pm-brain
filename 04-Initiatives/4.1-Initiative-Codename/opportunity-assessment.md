# [Initiative Codename] – Opportunity Assessment (Example)

> This is a **dummy example**. When you start a real initiative, copy this file and replace all content with your own.

## Objective
- [What outcome are we trying to achieve and why now?]
- [Business value hypothesis (e.g., revenue, risk reduction, cost, speed).]
- [Time horizon and exit criteria (what “good” looks like).]

## Target customer
- [Primary customer/user segment and context (JTBD, key workflows).]
- [Stakeholders impacted (internal/external) and success definition for each.]
- [Where/how we’ll reach them (channels, touchpoints).]

## Success metrics
- Leading indicators:
  - [Metric] — baseline: [x], target: [y] by [date]
- Lagging outcomes:
  - [Metric] — baseline: [x], target: [y] by [date]
- Guardrails (e.g., compliance, risk appetite, experience thresholds).

## What we know
- [Facts and evidence (link sources: data, interviews, prior initiatives).]
- [Constraints (regulatory, technical, operational, capacity).]
- [Assumptions with confidence level (e.g., High/Med/Low).]

## What we should research
- [Key questions/hypotheses to validate.]
- [Methods (interviews, data analysis, discovery experiments, prototypes).]
- [Participants, sample size, and timeline.]
- [Decision criteria (what would change our mind; kill/pivot/commit thresholds).]

## Solution ideas
- Concept 1: [one-liner] — first slice MVP scope.
- Concept 2: [one-liner] — alternative approach.
- Out of scope (for now) to protect focus.

## Risks and questions to validate
- Desirability (customer value, adoption risks).
- Viability (commercial model, business impact, go-to-market).
- Feasibility/Tech (integration, scalability, data availability).
- Usability (flow, UX, accessibility).
- Compliance/Legal (market rules, privacy, auditability).
- Dependencies (teams, vendors, data sources, timelines).
- Unknowns/Red flags and how we’ll de-risk.
