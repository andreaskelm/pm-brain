# 4.1 – [Initiative Codename]

This folder is an **example initiative** that shows how to structure early thinking, research links, and execution documents.

When you start a real initiative, copy this structure (or create a new `4.x-[Initiative-Name]/` folder) and replace all placeholder content.

## Suggested files

- `opportunity-assessment.md` – Early thinking, hypotheses, assumptions, and questions.  
- `summary.md` – One-pager/executive summary once the initiative is more concrete.  
- `prd.md` – Product requirements document (when ready to execute).  
- `roadmap.md` – Milestones, phases, and timelines for this initiative.  
- `decisions.md` – Simple decision log (what, why, who, when).  
- `risks.md` – Key risks and mitigations.  
- `research/` – Links to artifacts in `03-Research-Artifacts/` (interviews, synthesis, experiments).  
- `stakeholders/` – Stakeholder map and communication plan.  
- `metrics/` – Initiative-level metrics and links to dashboards.  

See `../README.md` for the full opportunity assessment template and process.
