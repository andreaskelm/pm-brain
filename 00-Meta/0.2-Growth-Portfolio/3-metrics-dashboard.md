## Product Judgment Test (Overall Brier trend)

Track your **calibration** over time. Update from [0.3-Product-Judgment-Test/dashboard.md](../0.3-Product-Judgment-Test/dashboard.md) after each monthly synthesis.

| Snapshot | Closed N | Overall Brier | Interpretation |
|----------|----------|---------------|----------------|
| *(YYYY-MM)* | | | |

*(Add a row each month. Lower Brier = better calibration. Goal: when you say 70% sure, you're right ~7/10 times.)*

## Other metrics (optional)

*(Add any other quantified evidence: practice consistency, decision hit rate, etc.)*
