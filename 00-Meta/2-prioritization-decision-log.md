## Prioritization Decision Log

> **Purpose:** Create a thin, high-signal log of important prioritization calls so you can see patterns in your judgment over time.
>
> Use this **before** or **after** you run RICE/ICE, MoSCoW, Impact–Effort, Kano, or any other scoring framework.

---

### How to Use This Log

- **When to log:** Any time you make a non-trivial call about what to do now vs. later.
- **Depth:** 5–10 minutes per entry. If the decision is big, link out to a deeper diagnostic using `2-product-sense-prompts.md (in 6-Product-Sense-Development)`.
- **Where frameworks fit:** Braindump and capture the log entry first, then use `02-Methods-and-Tools/2.1-Strategy/2.1.2-Strategic-Execution/4-Prioritization/` frameworks to structure and communicate.

You don’t need to log every tiny backlog grooming decision. Focus on:
- Roadmap sequencing
- Major bets vs. hygiene work
- Trade-offs between initiatives or themes

### Entry Template

Copy this section for each meaningful prioritization decision.

#### Decision Snapshot

- **Date:**  
- **Product / Area:**  
- **Context (1–2 sentences):**  
  > What situation are you in? (e.g. quarterly planning, fire drill, stakeholder push)

- **Decision:**  
  > What did you actually choose? (e.g. “Ship A before B”, “Delay initiative X”, “Kill Y”)

---

#### Product Sense Check (Before Scoring)

- **Who specifically is this for?**  
  > Name the *real* user/segment (not “our users”).

- **What job/pain/behavior are we really prioritizing?**  
  > Problem and job-to-be-done, not just the feature label.

- **What evidence do we have this matters?**  
  - Qualitative (stories, interviews):  
  - Quantitative (metrics, funnels, revenue, etc.):  
  - Gaps / soft spots in our evidence:

- **What’s the opportunity cost?**  
  > What are we *not* doing by choosing this?

- **What could go catastrophically wrong if we’re wrong on this bet?**  
  > Think second-order effects (user trust, technical debt, strategy drift).

---

#### Frameworks Used

- **Prioritization method(s):**  
  > e.g. RICE, ICE, Impact–Effort, MoSCoW, Kano.

- **Location:**  
  > Links to any filled-in templates (e.g. RICE sheet, MoSCoW doc, etc.).

---

#### Reflection (Later — Optional but High Value)

Fill this in **weeks/months later** when you can see some outcomes.

- **What actually happened?**  
  > Outcomes vs. what you expected.

- **What did I anticipate correctly?**  
  > Edge cases, second-order effects, stakeholder reactions, etc.

- **What did I miss?**  
  > Surprises, hidden costs, behavior changes.

- **If I were making this call again today, what would I do differently and why?**

- **Pattern I’m noticing in my prioritization decisions:**  
  > This is the real gold. Pull this into your learning log or growth portfolio if meaningful.

### Linking Suggestions

When you log a decision here, consider:
- Adding a short pointer in `daily-log-*.md` (for context of the day).
- Linking from relevant initiative docs in `04-Initiatives/` when the decision shapes an initiative.
- Pulling 1–2 of your best/worst decisions each quarter into `0.2-Growth-Portfolio/2-decision-showcase.md`.
