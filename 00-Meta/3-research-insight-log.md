## Research & Insight Log

> **Purpose:** Create a concise, reusable log of key insights from research and discovery work, and connect them back to prioritization and PRDs.
>
> Use this **right after** interviews, discovery sessions, or major user conversations.

### How to Use This Log

- **When to log:** After interviews, discovery calls, usability tests, or major product conversations with users/customers.
- **Depth:** 5–15 minutes per session (or per batch of closely related sessions).
- **Where frameworks fit:** Capture the raw insight here, then use discovery frameworks in `02-Methods-and-Tools/2.2-Discovery/` (JTBD, Opportunity Assessment, Problem–Solution Space, etc.) to structure and act on it.

Over time, this becomes your **evidence layer** for:
- Prioritization decisions
- PRDs and specs
- Strategy debates

#### Product Sense Translation

- **What problem or job is actually emerging here?**  
  > Frame in JTBD terms if possible.

- **How does this support or challenge our current prioritization assumptions?**  
  > Which bets look stronger/weaker based on this?

- **What surprised me?**  
  > Especially things you were hoping *not* to hear.

- **What assumption does this insight directly test?**  
  > Tie it back to an explicit hypothesis if you can.

#### Next Steps / Links

- **What should we do with this insight?**  
  > e.g. update opportunity assessment, tweak roadmap, design an experiment, change messaging, etc.

- **Linked artifacts (optional but powerful):**
  - `02-Methods-and-Tools/2.2-Discovery/...` docs updated because of this:
    - [ ]
  - `prioritization-decision-log.md` entries influenced by this insight:
    - [ ]
  - PRDs or initiatives in `04-Initiatives/` that should reference this:
    - [ ]

### Linking Suggestions

When you log an insight here, consider:
- Adding it to relevant **opportunity assessments** or **JTBD docs**.
- Referencing this log from future **prioritization** entries that rely on the same evidence.
- Pulling the most important insights into weekly/monthly reflections in `0.1-Learning-Log/`.
